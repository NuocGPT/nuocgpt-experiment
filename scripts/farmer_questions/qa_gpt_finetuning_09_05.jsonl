For instance, environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops like coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion is another factor that has reduced rice growing areas. However, agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high despite shrinking growing areas.The construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields, but these dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Other human activities unrelated to agriculture, such as sand mining and dam construction, can reduce rice productivity by reducing sediment availability and increasing channel erosion.Natural hazards like typhoons, floods, and droughts can also damage rice crops. Rice damage is worse if a typhoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods. Floods can be caused by heavy monsoonal rains, and while moderate levels of freshwater flooding may be beneficial to agricultural production, severe floods can cause damage. Droughts, though uncommon, have caused significant economic loss in the agriculture sector.In the future, climate change may exacerbate the effects of natural hazards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters. This could lead to an increase in problems such as excessive saltwater flooding and saltwater intrusion, which can further impact rice productivity."}]}

In the early stages of salinization, where a freshwater aquifer is being intruded by seawater, the fresh Ca2+-dominated groundwater becomes enriched in Na+ and Mg2+. This is due to divalent cations being exchanged on the mineral surface preferentially to monovalent cations. However, as salinization intensifies, this ion selectivity is masked by the proportional increase in sorption with increasing concentration, especially of the monovalent ion Na+. This leads to Na+ exchanging divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ from sedimentary rocks, forming Ca-Cl and Na-Mg-Cl waters, and increasing overall salinity. In this process, the Na+/Cl- ratio decreases below the conservative mixing line. Conversely, during freshening, or when freshwater inflows into saline coastal aquifers, the cation-exchange reaction is reversed. Freshwater of Ca-HCO3 type intrudes the saline aquifer and exchangeable Na+ on mineral surfaces is substituted by Ca2+ and Mg2+, leading to a change in water type to the characteristic Na-HCO3. This results in an increase in the Na+/Cl- ratio above the level of seawater. Therefore, the changes in these molar ion ratios can provide valuable insights into the processes of salinization and freshening in coastal aquifers."}]}

This is because dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter can be oxidized to dissolved inorganic carbon, which is a source of HCO3-. In fact, the concentration of HCO3- resulting from organic matter oxidation can exceed the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas several times over. Organic matter reduction also influences the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in PCO2 and changes in pH, leading to dissolution. In the context of the Mekong Delta, high amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers due to their marine and estuarial origin. This could account for high HCO3- concentrations. Sulfate reduction, which directly produces HCO3-, leads to sulfate depletion, a characteristic of freshening aquifers rich in organic matter. This could also apply to the Mekong Delta, indicating a potential link between organic matter and salinity intrusion."}]}

The presence of such groundwater in the northeast of the study area, where Cl- is below 25mg/L, suggests that the freshening process has progressed furthest in this region. This is further supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- between 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east.

This saltwater intrusion has had severe impacts on the area's natural resources and agricultural productivity. It has led to soil salinization, habitat loss, and reduced agricultural productivity. During periods of drought, the intrusion of saltwater along the tributaries of the delta can reach many kilometers from the sea, causing water salinity to exceed the critical threshold for irrigation.

Rising sea levels and stronger monsoons can lead to increased salinity in the soil and water, making them less suitable for traditional crops and drinking purposes. Droughts can exacerbate this issue by reducing the availability of freshwater resources and increasing the concentration of salts in the soil and water. The changing climate has also altered the predictable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes, making it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops. The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS2 buildup leading to reduced agriculture productivity, and degrades surface water quality. These changes also make aquatic ecosystems vulnerable and present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges for farmers. The increase in population and the rise in food and nutrition insecurity are further challenging the region to enhance their adaptation and agricultural production strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and livelihoods for Vietnamese farmers."}]}

This process replaced the wetland ecosystem with agricultural systems. However, the saline delta rivers, wetlands, and marshes were converted into perennial freshwater zones, which altered the seasonal variation in water flow patterns. This change also converted the flood plain into regulated canals, dykes, and polders that irrigated agriculture, preventing annual flood waters from submerging fields and replenishing soil fertility.In response to these changes and the increasing salinity of the soil and water, several measures are being taken. These include widening the adoption of diversified cropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization. There is also an increase in research, field evaluations, and applications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improving plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater. Other measures include increasing freshwater flows and aquifer recharge to offset saltwater intrusion, proactively preparing and protecting lands and settlements to increase resilience against tropical cyclones, and managing pesticide and fertilizer use to meet crop nutrient needs while reducing contamination."}]}

Canals that link to the Bassac and Mekong main stem rivers and their distributaries are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements. During the rainy season, these canals are used to drain the land and release flood waters back into rivers and seas. Sluice gates are also used to allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide, and are closed during the dry season and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields.During drought periods, saltwater intrusion can exacerbate, altering soil geochemistry and changing soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. This intrusion can affect the coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease and allow saline water to move further inland. The landward movement of saltwater can make the acidic delta soils less productive for crops and the shallow groundwater salty and unsafe for cooking or drinking. This can also affect the growth of crops like rice, which establishes and grows well in waterlogged environments but is sensitive to salinity."}]}

The height of these beds has a direct impact on the soil volume available for roots and the movement of water through the soil. Higher raised beds create a thicker zone of leaching, increasing the distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, which in turn increases the available soil volume for roots. Additionally, freshly excavated soil that is deposited as ridges or shaped into raised beds creates a network of macropores between soil clods. These macropores enable water to flow through the topsoil and bypass the unsaturated soil matrix. As a result, water can move quickly through the macropores of newly constructed raised beds."}]}

This process is used to remove or leach soluble Al and other soluble substances from the surface of the soil clods into the drainage or irrigation ditch. The purpose of this process is to remove additional toxic substances that can affect crop roots and plant development. The substances that are flushed with fresh water include soil Al, Fe, and SO42\u2013 concentrations. This is done in annual raised bed systems that are submerged during normal flooding and then planted after the flooding recedes. The process of flushing can also help reduce Al leaching by slowing the movement of water through the soil profile. However, it should be noted that when fresh water removes the Al from the soil, it can concentrate in the outflow to the ditch and potentially increase contamination in irrigation water downstream."}]}

PNSB application has shown to increase P availability, which is crucial for root growth, leaf and flowering, and fruit development. This has led to improvements in the growth, yields, and soil health of crops like mango, pineapple, and rice. PNSB solubilizing microbes are active in both aerobic and anerobic environments, making them well suited to the delta\u2019s wet-dry cycles.

These include salt-tolerant varieties of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), which can osmotically adjust by accumulating higher concentrations of Na+ in their roots during vegetative stages to minimize salinity damage. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) can withstand high levels of salinity due to its halophytic nature and efficiency in excluding Na+ from its leaves. In fact, quinoa has shown to have increased biomass and yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline conditions. Mustard greens (Brassica juncea) have also shown saline tolerance, associated with an increased sequestration of Na+ in roots. Maize (Zea mays) plants have been found to increase concentrations of proline, an osmoprotectant, in response to salt stress. However, the reproductive phases of maize are affected by salinity, leading to decreased kernel set and grain weight.

This sensor measures the water tension in the soil, eliminating the need to calibrate for soil type. It uses colored lights to indicate soil moisture status: blue for 'wet', green for 'moist', and red for 'dry'. This device has helped farmers in Tanzania to implement irrigation schedules based on quantitative data, saving significant amounts of water by reducing the frequency and duration of watering. It has also created social benefits among farmer groups by generating conversation and awareness of improved irrigation schedules. In the Mekong River Delta (MRD), the implementation of this sensor could limit soil salinisation by reducing the frequency of use of saline irrigation water.Effective drainage systems can also help manage soil salinisation. Salinity damage to plants can be minimised by removing excess saline water via effective drainage. Raised bed systems provide adequate drainage options for waterlogging sensitive plants and can help reduce the effects of salinity. In Bangladesh, a raised bed system combined with mulch produced significantly more potato tubers than flat ground with no mulch. The use of drainage pipes can also have similar benefits. Sub-surface drainage is known to remove excess saline water and helps reduce long-term soil salinisation.However, there are challenges to consider. The benefits of raised beds and drainage in reducing soil salinity levels are abundant, but their labour intensiveness must be considered when recommending their use in the MRD. Mechanisation is increasing in popularity in the MRD, but the availability of machinery may be a limiting factor."}]}
