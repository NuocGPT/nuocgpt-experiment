Question	Answer	Context
What are the major threats to agriculture in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam due to climate change, and what are some of the most common agricultural adaptation strategies being used to combat these issues?	Climate change poses significant threats to agriculture in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, particularly to rice production. Salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m can create unsuitable conditions for rice production, putting about 40% of the total rice harvest at high risk. Groundwater recharge is also expected to be substantially altered by climate change, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise, which range between 14-31 cm, indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater and jeopardizing around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Adaptation strategies to combat these issues are multifaceted and operate on different scales, as there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation. However, the context does not provide specific examples of the most common agricultural adaptation strategies being used in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam.

What were the impacts of the 2015/2016 El Niño event on rice production and water salinity levels in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	The 2015/2016 El Niño event had severe impacts on rice production and water salinity levels in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam. It led to one of the most severe droughts in the past 90 years in south Vietnam, causing a decline in water discharge in the upstream part of the Mekong River Delta. This, in turn, led to increased salinity levels in the lower part of the deltas due to saltwater intrusion. Salinity levels of more than 4 g/L were found in the river water up to 90 km distance from the coast. Eleven out of thirteen provinces and around 225,000 ha of rice land in the Mekong River Delta were adversely affected, resulting in high economic losses.

"""What are the main crops grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and what are the major challenges faced, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and water management, according to the context provided in the report?"""	The main crop grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam is rice, with an annual production of 25 million tons on 4.25 million hectares of harvested area. This region contributes to over 50% of the national rice export. However, the Mekong Delta faces significant challenges, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and water management. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which is unsuitable for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. The Delta has eight groundwater aquifers at different depths, and their levels and salt concentration vary depending on the season and distance to the coast. Climate change is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland and increase salinity in freshwater. This could jeopardize around 30,000 hectares of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

What are the potential threats to food security in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam due to salinity intrusion and inadequate water management as mentioned in the report on climate change?	The Mekong River Delta in Vietnam faces significant threats to food security due to salinity intrusion and inadequate water management.

"""What are the main crops grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and what are the major challenges faced in terms of water management and salinity intrusion according to the context provided?"""	The main crop grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam is rice, with an annual production of 25 million tons on 4.25 million hectares of harvested area. This region contributes to over 50% of the national rice export. However, the Mekong Delta faces significant challenges in terms of water management and salinity intrusion. The hydrological infrastructure of the delta has been greatly altered by human activity, and climate change is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Salinity levels pose a threat to rice production, and if they reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland and increase salinity in freshwater. This could jeopardize around 30,000 hectares of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

Based on the context, how does the seasonal variation in the Mekong River's flow rates contribute to saltwater intrusion and water scarcity in the Mekong Delta during the dry season?	During the rainy season, the Mekong River's flow rates are significantly higher, with the discharge being 25-30 times greater than during the dry season. However, in the dry season, which runs from December to April, the flow rates drop to around 6% of those during the monsoon season. This reduction in flow rates leads to seasonal water scarcity for up to 1.5 million hectares of irrigated land. Additionally, the lower water levels allow sea water to intrude into surface and groundwater resources, exacerbating the seasonal water scarcity.

Minar, Hossain, & Shamsuddin, 2013).Assuming an average yield of 4.3 t/ha,\n1 salinity in this particular area jeopardizes 3.4 million tons of rice \nor 7% of the national rice production.According to the Soil Science Development Institute (SRDI) of Bangladesh, reported in Rabbani, Munira, and Saif (2018), over 50% of the agricultural land of \nBangladesh is degraded by saline water.In addition, the rate of salt -\nwater intrusion is increasing with an average increase of 0.74% and a total expansion by 1.06 million ha from 1973 to 2009 (SRDI (2010) in Jabed, Paul, and Nath, (2018)).As a consequence of uncontrolled groundwater abstraction \nand overexploitation, water pollution including saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, lowering of groundwater table depths, decreased flows of rivers during the dry season and possible land subsidence was described (FAO, 2011).High relative sea level rise was reported for coastal areas in \nthe Ganges–Brahmaputra delta as over 20 mm per year (Ericson, \nVörösmarty, Dingman, Ward, & Meybeck,  2006).Similar findings \nwere reported by Singh et al.2000, reported in Baten, Seal, and Lisa (2015)), stating a relative sea level rise of 4.0–7.8 mm/year in three different locations in coastal Bangladesh.Dasgupta et al.(2014) investigated current and future river salin -\nity for the southwest region of Bangladesh, using different emission and relative sea level rise scenarios (RMSL) (Table 3).Even under the best-case scenario (B1 and 35 cm RMSL), the \nresults indicate that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh by 2050.The authors further estimated a decrease by 11.1% and 29.7% of area suitable for agriculture in the best case and worst-case (A2 and 67 cm RMSL) scenario, respectively.3.2\u2003|\u2003Mekong River Delta\nLow annual floods during rainy season inundate up to 35% of the area (Tuan et al., ;

What are the potential impacts of sea level rise and salinity intrusion on rice production in delta areas, and how might these conditions affect the yield of my crops in the Mekong Delta?	Sea level rise and salinity intrusion can have significant impacts on rice production in delta areas. In the Mekong River Delta, if salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest is at high risk. This equates to a loss of about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield. Climate change is expected to alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, and under certain emission scenarios, this could lead to a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land, with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons. Therefore, sea level rise and salinity intrusion could significantly affect the yield of your crops in the Mekong Delta.

Taft & Evers, 2016).3.7% (about 56,000 ha) of the rice-growing area in the delta are affected by salinity (Swe & Ando, 2016).Starting with the end of monsoon in November sea water in -\ntrudes into the mainland up to 100 km from the coastline and then gradually decreases with onset of the monsoon (Swe & Ando, 2016; Taft & Evers, 2016).Rising sea level increase soil salinity levels and consequently lead to a loss of arable land in the coastal area (Seinn Seinn, Ahman, Thapa, & Shresta, 2015).As summarized by Oo, Huylenbroeck, and Speelman (2018), salt intrusion poses a year-round threat on coastal areas of Myanmar and thus, is classified as a major threat for agriculture.As development of water dams and hydropower upstream of the \ndelta continues, the amount of sediments reaching the delta will de -\ncrease and erosion will accelerate in coastal land at the river mouth.Currently, no hydropower dams are installed yet at the Ayeyarwady River, but many are in the planning stage (Taft & Evers, 2016).So far, scientific and peer-reviewed research on impacts of an -\nthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations on the water resources in Ayeyarwady delta are lacking, but are extremely ur -\ngent for planning future water allocation and management (Taft & Evers,  2016).4\u2003| \u2003ADAPTATION OPTIONS\nIt is widely recognized that climate change poses a threat to both, people and environment at different levels.In AMDs, the impacts of global change pose a threat to agricultural production, food security, livelihood and national economies.However, climate change, and also sea level rise and salt intrusion are complex and multifaceted problems.Therefore, there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation possible, but there are many ways to address the problem on different scales.', '| \u2003497\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nto sustain protective barriers.Deep penetration of saline waters in \nthe delta plain leads to rapid delta fringe expansion in those cases.” Moreover, relative sea level rise, which includes the subsidence of deltas, is accelerating sea water intrusion.Main consequences for deltas are seen in the inundation and loss of land area, and conse -\nquently, the loss of coastal environments with important ecosystems and ecosystem functions.Salinity intrusion in ground- and surface water will increase in intensity and extent, and thus, reduce the amount of available freshwater for irrigation (Jiménez et al., 2014;

What are some of the adaptation options for rice farming in areas affected by salinity intrusion, as suggested in the report?	The report suggests several adaptation options for rice farming in areas affected by salinity intrusion. One of the basic agronomic interventions is the selection of appropriate rice varieties for the specific environment. For instance, replacing salinity-sensitive rice varieties with salinity-tolerant ones can help maintain rice production. Further research and breeding for salt- and drought-tolerant varieties with improved yields is also recommended. Adaptation options at the farm level include shifting to climate- and environment-adapted cropping cycles with adapted varieties. For example, in areas prone to prolonged tidal flooding, farmers can choose traditional varieties due to their higher level of salt tolerance. Another method is to adapt the crop establishment methods, such as transplanting, which allows farmers to better control the water quality in the nursery field than on the field after sowing. Water management is also an effective measure to mitigate soil salinity. This includes the use of water-saving technologies that reduce water requirements on the field and enhance system-scale water availability. Finally, alternative land use, such as crop rotations with less susceptible crops and rice-shrimp rotations, can help adapt to changing environmental conditions and mitigate farmer's income loss. However, the sustainability of these systems and their long-term impacts need to be carefully assessed.	"[""| \u2003499\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\non field-, farm- and landscape level with examples from the individ -\nual deltas.Technological options, such as construction of sea-dykes \nand sluice gates are not taken into consideration.4.1\u2003 |\u2003Agronomic interventions\nOne of the most basic agronomic interventions and, thus, basic adaptation options to cope with changing environments, is the se -\nlection of appropriate varieties for the specific environment (Asch, Dingkuhn, Miezan, & Doerffling, 2000).Smajgl et al., (2015) con -\ncluded “rice production could be maintained if salinity-sensitive rice varieties were replaced by salinity tolerant varieties subject to soil salinity levels up to 3‰.” In addition, the results point out the impor -\ntance of further research and breeding for salt- and drought-tolerant varieties with improved yields (Asch, Dingkuhn, & Doerffling, 2000).Moreover, implementation and dissemination of less susceptible rice varieties should, despite their lower yields, not be excluded in salin -\nity adaptation plans.Adaptation options on farm level include a shift to climate- and environment adapted cropping cycles with adapted varieties.Evidence from Myanmar showed, that farmers success -\nfully adapted to altered rainfall conditions by using cultivars with a shorter vegetation period.In areas prone to prolonged tidal flooding, farmers chose traditional varieties due to their higher level of salt tolerance.Despite efforts made from governmental organizations to allocate high-yielding salt-tolerant varieties, the dissemination was generally less successful (Seinn Seinn et al., 2015).The method of crop establishment methods may substantially in -\nfluence the yield in salt-affected areas.In seedling stage, rice plants are more sensitive to salinity than in other growth stages (Zeng, Shannon, & Lesch, 2001).Thus, farmers adapting transplanting as crop establishment method are able to control the water quality in the nursery field better than on field after sowing.Farmers in Ayeyarwady delta have adopted this management method to min -\nimize yield loss (Seinn Seinn et al., 2015).4.2\u2003|\u2003Water management\nWater management is an effective measure to mitigate soil salin -\nity: As summarized by Talebnejad and Sepaskhah (2014), environ -\nmental and management factors determine the contribution of groundwater in form of capillary rise to the root-zone.Water saving technologies have two main impact areas: Firstly, they reduce water requirements on field, and secondly they enhance system-scale water availability by shifting the water management scheme from a permanently flooded to a periodically flooded system (Lampayan, Rejesus, Singleton, & Bouman, 2015; Schneider, Sander, Wassmann, \n& Asch, 2019).In rice fields, soil salinity is often caused by inappro -\npriate irrigation, mainly when saline water is directly used for irriga -\ntion.Secondary soil salinization, derived from saline groundwater, is considerably low under paddy production due to a strong ploughing pan and the hydraulic head pressure of flooded soils, which reduce capillary salt movement.Under non-flooded conditions, however, the contribution of groundwater to the soil-water balance is higher (Talebnejad & Sepaskhah,  2014).Consequently, under given condi -\ntions, the choice of the appropriate irrigation technique may be a fine line between saving water and maintaining low salinity soil lev -\nels and therefore requires careful assessment.An important benefit of water saving technologies, such as \nAWD, is their potential to reduce methane emissions, a highly po -\ntent greenhouse gas.Linquist et al., (2015) estimate that the global warming potential of rice can be reduced with AWD by 45–90%.However, to our best knowledge, the influence of saline ground -\nwater on the root-zone under water saving techniques is not well studied and constitutes a potential risk of secondary soil salinization in AMDs.Currently, the application of water saving technologies is highly promoted by international and national research institutes in all delta countries and thus, more and more applied by farmers (Dong et al., 2012; Seinn Seinn et al., 2015).4.3\u2003|\u2003Alternative land use\nCrop rotations with less susceptible crops and alternative land use (e.g.rice-shrimp rotations) are further options to adapt to chang -\ning environmental condition and mitigate farmer's income loss.Smajgl et al."", '(2015) recommended a shift in agricultural produc -\ntion, mainly towards rice-aquaculture or rice-upland crop rotation for 180,000 ha in order to adapt to a 30 cm sea level rise.In rice-shrimp systems, rice is grown during monsoon season alternately shrimp in the dry season under higher salinity levels (5–40 ppt  \n(FAO, 1986).In an ideal world, the onset of the monsoon drains the field from salt and enables field preparation and rice transplanting.Indeed, shrimp farming was highly promoted to farmers in semi-coastal areas in recent years and farmers practising shrimp-rice rotational systems had on average 50% higher income than farm -\ners practising two rice crops (Anh, Kroeze, Bush, & Mol, 2010; Hossain & Hasan, 2017; Smajgl et al., 2015).In view of climate change and an expected shift of precipitation patterns, however, this system leads to a loss of highly valuable freshwater early in the season, because it is needed to remove the salt from the sys -\ntem (Christensen et al., 2013).As a consequence, farmers depend on the intensity of the remaining precipitation rendering the sus -\ntainability of this system questionable.In addition to effluents loaded with environmentally critical substances, soil salinization has been identified as one of the major long-terms impacts of shrimp culture (Ali, 2006; Anh et al., 2010; Chowdhury, Khairun, Salequzzaman, & Rahman,  2011; Clarke et  al., 2015).Therefore, \nintensification and expansion of rice-shrimp cultivation can lead to an increase in salinity-affected areas.Although the beneficial po-tential of diversified production is recognized, spatial-explicit suit -\nability as well as large scale and long-term impacts need to be assessed.Integrated water resource models describe hydrological \n\u200a3Parts per thousand.1439037x, 2020, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jac.12415 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [10/08/2023].See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use;

What are the potential long-term impacts of shrimp farming on soil salinity in the Mekong Delta, and how might this affect the sustainability of rice-shrimp rotational systems in the face of climate change?	Shrimp farming can lead to soil salinization, which is identified as one of the major long-term impacts of this practice. This intensification and expansion of rice-shrimp cultivation can result in an increase in salinity-affected areas. In the context of climate change and expected shifts in precipitation patterns, this system could lead to a loss of valuable freshwater early in the season, as it is needed to remove the salt from the system. As a result, farmers' dependence on the intensity of the remaining precipitation could make the sustainability of this system questionable.

Anh et al., 2010; Chowdhury, Khairun, Salequzzaman, & Rahman,  2011; Clarke et  al., 2015).Therefore, \nintensification and expansion of rice-shrimp cultivation can lead to an increase in salinity-affected areas.Although the beneficial po-tential of diversified production is recognized, spatial-explicit suit -\nability as well as large scale and long-term impacts need to be assessed.Integrated water resource models describe hydrological \n\u200a3Parts per thousand.1439037x, 2020, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jac.12415 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [10/08/2023].See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use;

Ha et al., 2015).Climate \nchange is going to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons (Bui, Nguyen, Bui, Le, & Le, 2017).Projections for sea level rise are ranging between 14-31 cm \n(MONRE, 2016, cited in in Vu et al.(2018)), and simulated under the RCP 6.0 emission scenario as 25-30cm (Vu et al., 2018).The results from Vu et al.(2018) indicate a shift of the brackish water front (<4 g/L) further inland (50–60 km).Locations with a proximity of 15–20 km to the coast are estimated to have an increase of salinity in freshwater by 0.5–2.5 g/L and locations with a distance of 30 km are estimated to have an increase of 1–1.5 g/L.Under this scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land are jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes.Also Wassmann et al., (2004) concluded that around 60% of the Mekong River Delta (2.3 million ha) are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.3.3\u2003|\u2003Ayeyarwady Delta\nFlood, droughts and salinity intrusion are substantial threats for the delta with an increasing trend over the last decades (MCCA, 2019; Taft & Evers, 2016).3.7% (about 56,000 ha) of the rice-growing area in the delta are affected by salinity (Swe & Ando, 2016).Starting with the end of monsoon in November sea water in -\ntrudes into the mainland up to 100 km from the coastline and then gradually decreases with onset of the monsoon (Swe & Ando, 2016; Taft & Evers, 2016).Rising sea level increase soil salinity levels and consequently lead to a loss of arable land in the coastal area (Seinn Seinn, Ahman, Thapa, & Shresta, 2015).As summarized by Oo, Huylenbroeck, and Speelman (2018), salt intrusion poses a year-round threat on coastal areas of Myanmar and thus, is classified as a major threat for agriculture.As development of water dams and hydropower upstream of the \ndelta continues, the amount of sediments reaching the delta will de -\ncrease and erosion will accelerate in coastal land at the river mouth.Currently, no hydropower dams are installed yet at the Ayeyarwady River, but many are in the planning stage (Taft & Evers, 2016).So far, scientific and peer-reviewed research on impacts of an -\nthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations on the water resources in Ayeyarwady delta are lacking, but are extremely ur -\ngent for planning future water allocation and management (Taft & Evers,  2016).4\u2003| \u2003ADAPTATION OPTIONS\nIt is widely recognized that climate change poses a threat to both, people and environment at different levels.In AMDs, the impacts of global change pose a threat to agricultural production, food security, livelihood and national economies.However, climate change, and also sea level rise and salt intrusion are complex and multifaceted problems.Therefore, there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation possible, but there are many ways to address the problem on different scales.']
What are the potential impacts of alterations in freshwater availability and seawater intrusion induced by climate change on rice production in the Mekong Delta, as discussed in the report by Schneider and Asch?	Climate change is expected to significantly alter the availability of freshwater in the Mekong Delta, which could have substantial impacts on rice production. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, conditions could become unsuitable for rice production, putting about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta at high risk. Groundwater, an important source for municipal and industrial water demands, is also expected to be affected, with substantial alterations in groundwater recharge, particularly high reduction during dry seasons. Sea level rise projections range between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland by 50–60 km. Locations close to the coast are estimated to have an increase of salinity in freshwater by 0.5–2.5 g/L and locations with a distance of 30 km are estimated to have an increase of 1–1.5 g/L. Under this scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land could be jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.	['| \u2003503\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nThanh, N. C.

The report discusses the impact of climate change on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, particularly in relation to sea level rise. It highlights the issue of saltwater intrusion, which is a significant consequence of rising sea levels. This phenomenon can have serious implications for rice production, a critical aspect of food security in the region. The report also discusses the need for adaptation strategies to manage the effects of climate change, including changes in water management practices for rice cultivation.

"""What are the potential impacts of climate change, particularly salinity intrusion, on rice production in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam?"""	Climate change, particularly salinity intrusion, poses significant threats to rice production in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta, or about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, are at high risk. Groundwater, an important source for municipal and industrial water demands, is also expected to be substantially altered by climate change, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land, with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Additionally, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.	['| \u2003503\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nThanh, N. C.

"""What are the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater resources and rice production in the Mekong Delta, according to the report by Schneider and Asch?"""	Climate change can lead to saltwater intrusion and sea level rise, which can significantly impact freshwater resources in the Mekong Delta. This, in turn, can affect rice production, as rice cultivation requires a substantial amount of freshwater. Additionally, changes in the flood season due to rising water levels can also have implications for rice production. Methane emissions from rice cultivation in different agro-ecological zones of the Mekong river delta can also be influenced by climate change.	['| \u2003503\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nThanh, N. C.

What are the potential impacts of floods, salinity intrusion, and climate change on rice production in the Mekong River Delta, as discussed in the report?	The report discusses several potential impacts of floods, salinity intrusion, and climate change on rice production in the Mekong River Delta. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. Climate change is expected to significantly alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, and under the RCP 6.0 emission scenario, it's simulated as 25-30cm. This could shift the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. Under this scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land are jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

What are the potential impacts of climate change, specifically rising sea levels, on rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, as discussed in the report?	Rising sea levels due to climate change pose a significant threat to rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. Climate change is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, and under certain emission scenarios, this could lead to a shift of the brackish water front further inland. Locations close to the coast are estimated to have an increase of salinity in freshwater, jeopardizing around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

"""What are the potential impacts of coastal salinity on rice production as discussed in the case study of Pyapon Township, Ayeyarwady Region in Myanmar, and how might these impacts be relevant to my rice farming in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?"""	The context does not provide specific information on the case study of Pyapon Township, Ayeyarwady Region in Myanmar. However, it does mention that in the Ayeyarwady Delta, salinity intrusion is a substantial threat to rice production, with an increasing trend over the last decades. About 3.7% of the rice-growing area in the delta is affected by salinity. Rising sea levels increase soil salinity levels, leading to a loss of arable land in the coastal area. This salt intrusion poses a year-round threat on coastal areas of Myanmar and is classified as a major threat for agriculture.In the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m pose unsuitable conditions for rice production. About 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk if these salinity levels are reached. Climate change is expected to alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise could lead to a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Therefore, the impacts of coastal salinity on rice production in the Ayeyarwady Delta could be relevant to your rice farming in the Mekong Delta, as both regions face similar threats from salinity intrusion due to sea level rise and climate change.

Tuan, Hoanh, Miller, & Sinh, ; Tuan et al., 2007).Freshwater availability is strongly influenced by monsoon rain and upstream river discharge.During the rainy season from June to November, areas of the Mekong river below 4 m above sea level are exposed to floods and discharge of the river is 25–30 times higher compared with dry season flows (Tuan et al., ; Tuan et al., 2007).According to \nTuan et al.() and Tuan et al.(2007) up to 1.9 million ha of land are sea -\nsonally flooded.During the dry season from December to April, the Mekong River has flow rates which are only around 6% of flow rates during monsoon season, leading to seasonal water scarcity for up to 1.5 million ha of irrigated land.Groundwater levels drop by 2–3 me -\nters and sea water intrudes into surface and groundwater resources, which further enhances seasonal water scarcity (Tuan et al., ;  \nTuan et al., 2007).2.1.3\u2003 |\u2003Ayeyarwady Delta\nThe Ayeryawady Delta in Myanmar covers an area of about 2 million ha and accounts for about 3% of Myanmars total area.It is character -\nized by a tropical monsoon climate with distinct rainy and dry sea -\nsons (Table 2).The delta is one of the most important rice-growing areas of the country as more than 50% of the total arable land is used for rice cultivation (Coleman et al., 2003; GRiSP, 2013; MOAI, 2015; Naing, Kingsbury, Buerkert, & Finckh, 2008).Myanmar is the sixth largest rice producer in the world, achieving \nan annual rice production of 26 million tons (GRiSP, 2013).Rice production is sustaining food security and plays a key role in \nincome generation and employment.82% of Myanmar's population is employed in agriculture (MOAI,  2015).More than 60% of the rice comes from rainfed production during \nmonsoon season (Figure 2), and only about 20% comes from irri -\ngated systems (FAO, 2002).The green revolution and expansion or improvement of irriga -\ntion infrastructure led to a shift in the use of cultivated varieties, use of fertilizers and crop rotations (Naing et al., 2008).However, the \nirrigation infrastructure is still poorly developed.According to the FAO (2012), Myanmar's total irrigation area increased from 1995 (1.5 million ha) to 2004 (2.1 million ha) by about 7% annually.All irrigation water comes from surface water (FAO, 2012).The Ayeyarwady is the country's most important river system, \nwith high variations in river discharge.As stated in Taft and Evers (2016), nearly two-thirds of the annual river discharge occur during rainy season, with the lowest rates in the dry season from February to March (Driel & Nauta, 2015).The river network is influenced by diurnal tides, and saltwater is entering deep into the delta (Driel & Nauta, 2015).The river system is natural and less man-modified as compared to the river networks of Ganges–Brahmaputra delta and Mekong River Delta.Only a few sluice gates were built in the lower delta to prevent the intrusion of saltwater (Driel & Nauta, 2015).As indicated by Taft and Evers (2016), research and information \non the Ayeyarwady river basin are lacking, in particular on current and future impacts of climate change and human interventions on water resources.3\u2003| \u2003THREATS\nAccording to the fifth assessment report of the IPCC, AMDs are ranked among the regions being most vulnerable to impacts of cli -\nmate change, which is mainly due to their specific geographic setting and low elevation (Clarke et al., 2015; Cruz et al., 2007).Global climate change and an increase of interventions in natural \nstreamflow interrupt the natural balance of fresh- and saltwater, as well as sedimentation load.Thus, freshwater scarcity and erosion are major threats for tidal influenced deltas.""]"
What are the potential impacts of sea level rise due to climate change on seawater intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and how might this affect rice production?	Sea level rise due to climate change is projected to significantly alter the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. It's expected to increase the salinity levels in the groundwater, especially during dry seasons. This is particularly concerning as salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m can create unsuitable conditions for rice production. Under certain scenarios, it's estimated that about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta, or about 9.86 tonnes, could be at high risk. Furthermore, the shift of the brackish water front further inland could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land, leading to an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Additionally, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is considered highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

"""What are the potential impacts of climate change on rice production and food security in Asian Mega deltas like the Mekong Delta, according to the review by Schneider and Asch?"""	Climate change can have several impacts on rice production and food security in Asian Mega deltas like the Mekong Delta. These impacts include saltwater intrusion, changes in hydrology and hydraulic infrastructure systems, and alterations in flood and salinity management. Climate change can also lead to sea level rise, which can affect water elevation in the flood season, with implications for rice production. Additionally, climate change can affect methane emission from rice cultivation in different agro-ecological zones of the Mekong river delta. Furthermore, the impact of sea level rise due to climate change can lead to increased seawater intrusion. These changes can pose challenges to sustainable development in these regions.

"""How have anthropogenic developments and natural hazards, such as climate-change-induced sea level rise, impacted the salinity intrusion and subsequently the rice production and quality in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?"""	Anthropogenic developments and natural hazards have significantly impacted salinity intrusion and rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. Developments such as the construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding have facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields. However, these dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Furthermore, environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their now-unusable rice fields into shrimp ponds or turn to growing salt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion has also reduced rice growing areas, although agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high despite shrinking growing areas. The construction of upstream dams and sand mining have reduced sediment availability and increased channel erosion, which could have adverse implications on agricultural productivity.Natural hazards like typhoons, floods, and droughts can damage rice crops, and climate change may exacerbate these effects by increasing the frequency and severity of these disasters. Sea level rise induced by climate change, coupled with land subsidence from groundwater extraction, could potentially reduce rice growing areas in the future. Moreover, excessive use of agrochemicals can affect rice quality and may increase the prevalence of pests and diseases. Overall, these anthropogenic developments and natural hazards have created a complex interplay of factors that have significant implications for rice production and quality in the Mekong Delta.	['1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.']
Based on the context, how does the vulnerability of the Mekong River Delta to environmental hazards impact agricultural production in the region?	The vulnerability of the Mekong River Delta to environmental hazards significantly impacts agricultural production in the region. Natural hazards such as typhoons, floods, and droughts can cause substantial damage to crops, particularly rice, which is a staple food and key export crop for Vietnam. For instance, typhoons can cause severe damage to rice crops, especially if they occur during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods. Floods, often caused by heavy monsoonal rains, can also damage crops, although moderate levels of freshwater flooding can sometimes benefit agricultural production. Droughts, while less common, have caused significant economic loss, particularly in the agriculture sector. The 2015-2016 drought, for example, affected all the Mekong River Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 million in damage, with USD 300 million being agriculture- and aquaculture-related damage.In addition to natural hazards, anthropogenic factors also impact agricultural production. Changes in land use, driven by higher prices and rising demand for aquaculture and non-rice products, have led farmers to shift away from rice monoculture. Environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops. Urban expansion is another key factor that has reduced rice growing areas. Despite these challenges, agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high. However, the construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has reduced the availability of fertile silt, forcing farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields.	['1474 K. W.

W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 4. Flow diagram showing the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. The drivers\nare classiﬁed as a local driver if it occurs in the two mega-deltas. Regional drivers are those that occur farther away from the two mega-deltas\nbut within the Asian region. A plus ( +) sign indicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to increase (decrease). A negative ( −) sign\nindicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to decrease (increase). Dashed lines with “ ±” are used when outcomes are unclear. For\nexample, dikes reduce ﬂooding, but poorly maintained or planned dikes increase ﬂooding instead. In addition, dikes may potentially cause\nﬂooding in unprotected areas. Agrochemical use may reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but the overuse of chemicals can lead to\npesticide resistance, which may increase outbreaks of pests and diseases.\nFinally, government policies encouraging farmers to move\naway from growing rice also contributed to the planting of\nmore non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is\nincreased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards,\nand freshwater and brackish aquaculture (Van Kien et al.,\n2020). Using remote sensing to assess land-use and land-\ncover change in the Mekong River Delta, Liu et al. (2020)\nfound that aquaculture had become the second-largest land-\nuse type, following planted land. This was facilitated by gov-\nernment regulations, salt intrusion and higher proﬁtability\nof aquaculture productions. In any case, even though farm-\ners may have moved on from growing rice, many still con-\ntinue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops\n(Normile, 2013; Fig. 4).\n3.1.2 Urban expansion\nRapid urbanization is accelerating the loss of agricultural\nland in both the Red River Delta and Mekong River Delta. In\nHanoi, a major city in the Red River Delta, 1420 ha of agri-cultural land was lost per year from 2000–2007, equivalent to\na yearly loss of 3 %. By 2025, up to 450 000 ha of agricultural\nland is expected to be converted to urban land. Most of this\nland-use conversion occurs in peri-urban areas 5–15 km from\nthe city center. The same peri-urban land is often used to\ngrow food, ﬂowers and livestock for the urban population in\nHanoi. However, this land is considered by local authorities\nto be land reserve for urban planning instead of resources for\nfood supply (Drebold, 2017; Pham et al., 2015). Most of this\nperi-urban agricultural land is often forcibly obtained, with\nminimal compensation given to farmers, and then sold to for-\neign developers (Drebold, 2017). Similar urban expansion is\nalso occurring in Can Tho city in the Mekong River Delta,\nwith corresponding losses of agricultural land (cf. Garscha-\ngen et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2010). A decline in agricultural\nland means a decline in rice growing areas as well (Fig. 4).\nHigh land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land\nhave forced farmers to practice agricultural intensiﬁcation. In\nthe RRD, rice production grew more than 25 % from 2000–\n2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

How has worsening saltwater intrusion affected rice production in the Mekong Delta, and what alternative crops are farmers turning to in response to this issue?	The context does not provide specific information on how worsening saltwater intrusion has affected rice production in the Mekong Delta, nor does it mention what alternative crops farmers are turning to in response to this issue.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021']
"""How does the interaction of anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers affect rice production in the Mekong River Delta, according to the systems-thinking approach?"""	The systems-thinking approach presents an integrated view of how anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers interact to influence rice production in the Mekong River Delta. It shows that these drivers are interrelated and interdependent, and their processes can either reinforce or diminish rice production. For instance, changes in land use due to human activities and natural hazards can affect the areas where rice is grown, the quantity of rice produced, and the quality of the rice. This approach also highlights that the issues affecting food security are not one-dimensional and linear, but rather reinforcing and interdependent. It allows for the visualization and mapping of the multitude of drivers and environmental processes affecting rice production, which can help in understanding the complexity of the problem and in avoiding oversimplification when seeking solutions.	['On a more technical level,\nChapman and Darby (2016) used system dynamics modeling\nto simulate the delays, feedbacks and tipping points between\nfarmers’ socioeconomic status and the practice of double- or\ntriple-cropping in An Giang Province in the MRD.Building\non the framework provided by these studies, we use systems-\nthinking to present an overarching picture of how anthro-\npogenic and natural-hazard drivers can interact to reinforce\nor diminish rice production.While many studies may have\nhighlighted the links between the various drivers and rice\nproduction, we seek to integrate the different drivers of an-\nthropogenic change and natural hazards to show their inter-\nrelated and interdependent nature and how the processes as-\nsociated with each driver affect rice growing areas, rice pro-\nduction and rice quality in general.The use of systems-thinking is appropriate as the wicked\nenvironmental problems present in the deltas of Vietnam\nare caused by a range of interdependent anthropogenic and\nnatural hazards drivers operating at multiple scales with no\neasily identiﬁable, predeﬁned solutions.While interventions\nmay be made to ameliorate problems, these interventions\nmay create feedbacks and unanticipated outcomes (Rittel\nand Webber, 1973; DeFries and Nagendra, 2017).In addi-\ntion, systems-thinking can be applied in a range of contexts\nand at multiple scales.Geist and Lambin (2002) and Lim et\nal.(2017) applied a system-dynamics approach to understand\ndrivers of deforestation and forest degradation at the national\nand global scales, while Ziegler et al.(2016) used a trans-\ndisciplinary learning approach to understand the role of en-\nvironmental and cultural factors in driving the development\nof human diseases in northeastern Thailand at the landscape\nscale.Our aim is to use a literature review to develop ﬂow dia-\ngrams to represent the major linkages between anthropogenic\nland-use factors and natural hazards and elaborate on how\nthey interact and inﬂuence rice productivity in these two\ndeltas.Due to the importance of Vietnam as a major rice pro-\nducer and exporter in Southeast Asia as well as the range of\nthreats faced by the rice sector from natural hazards and an-\nthropogenic land use, we hope to show how the processes\nand issues affecting food security are not one-dimensional\nand linear but in fact reinforcing and interdependent.Lastly,\ngiven that deltas worldwide are globally signiﬁcant for food\nproduction and are highly stressed and degraded landscapes,\nwe argue that a systems-thinking approach can be applied to\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'Additionally, a systems-\nthinking approach has allowed the multitude of drivers and\nenvironmental processes affecting rice production to be visu-\nalized and mapped in a manner that is easy to understand.As\nameliorating problems require policymakers and managers\nto have a good grasp of the different factors and processes\npresent, a method that considers all the different drivers and\npossible unintended consequences from the outset can avoid\noversimplifying a problem and assuming a straightforward\nsolution can be found (DeFries and Nagendra, 2017).For ex-\nample, to solve the problem of a shrinking delta, the effects of\n(high) dikes, sand mining, upstream dams and groundwater\nextraction have to be considered.While typhoons may pro-\nvide some ﬂuvial sediment to offset a shrinking delta (Darby\net al., 2016), the sediment load provided may not be sufﬁ-\ncient to offset sediment loss from sand mining and upstream\ndams.4.2 Adaptation and soft solutions\nRecognizing the environmental challenges limiting agricul-\ntural production, farmers in both deltas have adapted and im-\nprovised.Instead of accepting their fate, farmers overcome\nhigh soil salinities by implementing measures such as re-\nplacing rice with salinity-tolerant crops; transiting to shrimp\naquaculture; or turning to rice–shrimp farming, whereby rice\nis grown in the wet season, and shrimp is cultivated in the\ndry season.For those unable to switch from rice monocul-\nture, farmers have sought to grow rice on higher ground,\nshift crop calendars, or dig additional ditches to drain salt-\nwater and store fresh water.In addition, to prevent water\nstorage ponds from becoming contaminated with saltwater,\ncanvas sheets are placed on the soil surface to create a pro-\ntective barrier (Tran et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2012).Simi-\nlarly, farmers in peri-urban areas who are faced with shrink-\ning agricultural lands have turned to practicing agricultural\nintensiﬁcation and/or switched to planting high-value crops\nsuch as fruits and vegetables (Morton, 2020; van den Berg\net al., 2003).In short, farmers are constantly experimenting,\nlearning and sharing knowledge and experiences with other\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021']

"""How many rice crops are produced annually in the Mekong River Delta and what are their respective production volumes?"""	In the Mekong River Delta, three rice crops are produced annually. In 2018, the spring, autumn, and winter paddies covered areas of 1.6 million ha, 2.3 million ha, and 197.2 thousand ha respectively. The total rice planted over these three seasons was 4.1 million ha, producing 24.5 million tonnes of rice.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1475\nprovide a holistic and contextualized overview of the threats\nfaced in each location.2 Methods\n2.1 Study sites\nThe Mekong River Delta (MRD) is the world’s third-largest\ndelta, with a physical area of 4 million ha, and it is the\nlarger of the two deltas in Vietnam (Schneider and Asch,\n2020; Fig.1).In 2018, the planted area for spring, autumn\nand winter paddies was 1.6 million ha, 2.3 million ha and\n197.2 thousand ha, respectively.In total, 4.1 million ha of rice\nwas planted over the three planting seasons, with 24.5 million\ntonnes of rice produced.The delta is home to 17.8 million\npeople, with many dependent on agriculture for their liveli-\nhoods.That 54 % of Vietnam’s rice is grown in the MRD, and\nmost of it is exported overseas, makes it strategically impor-\ntant for the Vietnamese economy and for global food security\n(Chapman et al., 2016; Cosslett and Cosslett, 2018; General\nStatistics Ofﬁce of Vietnam, 2020).Up north, the Red River\nDelta (RRD) is the next largest, with a physical delta area of\n1.5 million ha (Fig.1; Schneider and Asch, 2020).In 2018,\n1 million ha of planted rice produced 6.3 million tonnes of\nrice, the equivalent of 14 % of Vietnam’s total rice produc-\ntion (524.3 and 516.4 thousand ha of rice was planted in\nthe spring and winter seasons, respectively).Approximately\n21.6 million people live in the RRD, with many also de-\npendent on agriculture (General Statistics Ofﬁce of Vietnam,\n2020).Soils in the MRD are highly variable, with alluvial, acid\nsulfate and saline soils dominant.Most of the rice grows\nin the highly fertile alluvial soils, which are found in only\n30 % of the delta (GRSP, 2013).Conversely, soils in the RRD\nconsist of Holocene delta sediments.These Holocene delta\nsediments are relatively ﬁne-grained muds and sands, up to\n30 m thick, that are the product of rapid progradation during\nthe Holocene high sea level stand (Mathers and Zalasiewicz,\n1999).The Holocene sequence overlies coarse-grained Pleis-\ntocene sediments dominated by braided river and alluvial fan\ndeposits formed during the last glacial low sea level stand.The Quaternary sediments are underlain by a >400 m thick\nlayer of Neogene sedimentary rocks that are made up of con-\nglomerate sandstone, clay and siltstone (Berg et al., 2007).Climatically, the MRD has a tropical monsoon climate\nwith two distinct seasons, a dry season from December to\nApril and a rainy season from May to November.It is gen-\nerally warm year round, with average temperatures in 2018\nranging from 26◦C in December, January and February to\n29◦C in May.The annual rainfall is between 2000 and\n2400 mm (General Statistics Ofﬁce, 2018; Kotera et al.,\n2008).Conversely, the RRD has a tropical monsoon climate\nwith three seasons: (1) a hot and wet season from May to\nSeptember, (2) a cool and dry season from October to Jan-uary, and (3) a cool and humid season from February to\nApril.The hot and wet season is characterized by high tem-\nperatures and high rainfall, the cool and dry season has mod-\nerate to low temperatures and low rainfall, and the cool and\nhumid season has low to moderate temperatures and low\nrainfall (Huong et al., 2013; Li et al., 2006).In 2018, the\nmonthly average temperatures in the RRD ranged from 17◦C\nin February to 30◦C in June.Average annual rainfall is be-\ntween 1300 and 1800 mm (Li et al., 2006; General Statis-\ntics Ofﬁce, 2018).Both deltas are low-lying, with elevations\nranging from 0.7 to 1.2 m a.s.l.(above sea level) (Binh et al.,\n2017).', 'K.

In the Mekong River Delta, salinity intrusion\nis a naturally occurring phenomenon during the dry season.\nTides from the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand\nbring saltwater inland, and salinity intrudes up to 70–90 km\ninland as the length of sea dikes is limited. There are 1500 km\nof sea and estuary dikes in RRD versus 450 km of sea dikes\nin the MRD (Le et al., 2018; Preston et al., 2003; Pilarcyzk\nand Nguyen, 2005). Thus, salinity intrusion extends up to20 km from the main river in the RRD (Ca et al., 1994). As\nrice plants are unable to thrive in soils with soil salinities ex-\nceeding 4 g L−1(V . H. T. Pham et al., 2018), affected farmers\nhave converted their paddy ﬁelds into aquaculture ponds to\ncultivate shrimp and ﬁsh instead. Other farmers have turned\nto planting salinity-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango\nand sugarcane. In some cases, farmers have opted for a rice-\naquaculture system, whereby rice is planted in the wet sea-\nson, and ﬁsh and shrimp are cultivated in the dry season,\nwhen soil salinities are high (Nguyen and V o, 2017; Pham\net al., 2017).\nBesides environmental factors, the greater proﬁtability of\nfruits, vegetables, ﬁsh and shrimp also incentivizes farmers\nto plant more non-rice crops. The income per hectare of\nrice was USD 146 compared to pomelo (USD 16 844) and\ncoconut (USD 1484) (Hoang and Tran, 2019). Meanwhile,\nfarmers who practice shrimp–rice rotational systems earned\n50 % more than those who had two rice crops (Morton, 2020;\nSchneider and Asch, 2020). In addition, high demand for\nfruits and vegetables for export and from growing urban pop-\nulations with greater afﬂuence and knowledge about nutrition\nalso encouraged farmers to diversify from rice monoculture,\nleading to possible declines in the overall rice growing area\n(Hai, 2021; Nguyen and V o, 2017; Fig. 4).\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.

"""How does the increase or decrease in anthropogenic drivers influence rice productivity in the Mekong Delta, according to the report?"""	Anthropogenic drivers can significantly influence rice productivity in the Mekong Delta. For instance, government policies encouraging farmers to shift from rice to non-rice crops have led to increased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards, and aquaculture. This shift was facilitated by factors such as government regulations, salt intrusion, and the higher profitability of aquaculture. Urban expansion is another driver that affects rice production. Rapid urbanization has led to the loss of agricultural land, which in turn reduces rice growing areas. High land prices and limited availability of arable land have forced farmers to intensify their agricultural practices. The construction of dikes to mitigate flooding has allowed for triple-cropping of rice and increased yields. However, these dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt, forcing farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Lastly, the use of agrochemicals can have both positive and negative effects on rice production. While they can reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, overuse can lead to pesticide resistance, potentially increasing outbreaks of pests and diseases.	['1478 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 4. Flow diagram showing the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. The drivers\nare classiﬁed as a local driver if it occurs in the two mega-deltas. Regional drivers are those that occur farther away from the two mega-deltas\nbut within the Asian region. A plus ( +) sign indicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to increase (decrease). A negative ( −) sign\nindicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to decrease (increase). Dashed lines with “ ±” are used when outcomes are unclear. For\nexample, dikes reduce ﬂooding, but poorly maintained or planned dikes increase ﬂooding instead. In addition, dikes may potentially cause\nﬂooding in unprotected areas. Agrochemical use may reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but the overuse of chemicals can lead to\npesticide resistance, which may increase outbreaks of pests and diseases.\nFinally, government policies encouraging farmers to move\naway from growing rice also contributed to the planting of\nmore non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is\nincreased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards,\nand freshwater and brackish aquaculture (Van Kien et al.,\n2020). Using remote sensing to assess land-use and land-\ncover change in the Mekong River Delta, Liu et al. (2020)\nfound that aquaculture had become the second-largest land-\nuse type, following planted land. This was facilitated by gov-\nernment regulations, salt intrusion and higher proﬁtability\nof aquaculture productions. In any case, even though farm-\ners may have moved on from growing rice, many still con-\ntinue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops\n(Normile, 2013; Fig. 4).\n3.1.2 Urban expansion\nRapid urbanization is accelerating the loss of agricultural\nland in both the Red River Delta and Mekong River Delta. In\nHanoi, a major city in the Red River Delta, 1420 ha of agri-cultural land was lost per year from 2000–2007, equivalent to\na yearly loss of 3 %. By 2025, up to 450 000 ha of agricultural\nland is expected to be converted to urban land. Most of this\nland-use conversion occurs in peri-urban areas 5–15 km from\nthe city center. The same peri-urban land is often used to\ngrow food, ﬂowers and livestock for the urban population in\nHanoi. However, this land is considered by local authorities\nto be land reserve for urban planning instead of resources for\nfood supply (Drebold, 2017; Pham et al., 2015). Most of this\nperi-urban agricultural land is often forcibly obtained, with\nminimal compensation given to farmers, and then sold to for-\neign developers (Drebold, 2017). Similar urban expansion is\nalso occurring in Can Tho city in the Mekong River Delta,\nwith corresponding losses of agricultural land (cf. Garscha-\ngen et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2010). A decline in agricultural\nland means a decline in rice growing areas as well (Fig. 4).\nHigh land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land\nhave forced farmers to practice agricultural intensiﬁcation. In\nthe RRD, rice production grew more than 25 % from 2000–\n2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M.

What are some of the changes farmers in the Mekong Delta have made to their farming practices due to the widespread salinity intrusion threatening rice production?	Due to the widespread salinity intrusion threatening rice production, farmers in the Mekong Delta have made several changes to their farming practices. Some have shifted away from rice monoculture to embrace non-rice crops, incentivized by higher prices and rising demand for aquaculture and non-rice products. Environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their now-unusable rice fields into shrimp ponds. Others have turned to growing salt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango, and sugar cane.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '1474 K.

Based on the context, how has the shift from rice farming to aquaculture, driven by government regulations and salt intrusion, impacted the use of paddy land in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	The shift from rice farming to aquaculture in the Mekong Delta, driven by government regulations and salt intrusion, has led to an increased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards, and both freshwater and brackish aquaculture. This change was also facilitated by the higher profitability of aquaculture productions. As a result, aquaculture has become the second-largest land-use type in the Mekong Delta, following planted land. Despite this shift, many farmers who have moved on from growing rice still continue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops.	['1478 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 4. Flow diagram showing the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. The drivers\nare classiﬁed as a local driver if it occurs in the two mega-deltas. Regional drivers are those that occur farther away from the two mega-deltas\nbut within the Asian region. A plus ( +) sign indicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to increase (decrease). A negative ( −) sign\nindicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to decrease (increase). Dashed lines with “ ±” are used when outcomes are unclear. For\nexample, dikes reduce ﬂooding, but poorly maintained or planned dikes increase ﬂooding instead. In addition, dikes may potentially cause\nﬂooding in unprotected areas. Agrochemical use may reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but the overuse of chemicals can lead to\npesticide resistance, which may increase outbreaks of pests and diseases.\nFinally, government policies encouraging farmers to move\naway from growing rice also contributed to the planting of\nmore non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is\nincreased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards,\nand freshwater and brackish aquaculture (Van Kien et al.,\n2020). Using remote sensing to assess land-use and land-\ncover change in the Mekong River Delta, Liu et al. (2020)\nfound that aquaculture had become the second-largest land-\nuse type, following planted land. This was facilitated by gov-\nernment regulations, salt intrusion and higher proﬁtability\nof aquaculture productions. In any case, even though farm-\ners may have moved on from growing rice, many still con-\ntinue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops\n(Normile, 2013; Fig. 4).\n3.1.2 Urban expansion\nRapid urbanization is accelerating the loss of agricultural\nland in both the Red River Delta and Mekong River Delta. In\nHanoi, a major city in the Red River Delta, 1420 ha of agri-cultural land was lost per year from 2000–2007, equivalent to\na yearly loss of 3 %. By 2025, up to 450 000 ha of agricultural\nland is expected to be converted to urban land. Most of this\nland-use conversion occurs in peri-urban areas 5–15 km from\nthe city center. The same peri-urban land is often used to\ngrow food, ﬂowers and livestock for the urban population in\nHanoi. However, this land is considered by local authorities\nto be land reserve for urban planning instead of resources for\nfood supply (Drebold, 2017; Pham et al., 2015). Most of this\nperi-urban agricultural land is often forcibly obtained, with\nminimal compensation given to farmers, and then sold to for-\neign developers (Drebold, 2017). Similar urban expansion is\nalso occurring in Can Tho city in the Mekong River Delta,\nwith corresponding losses of agricultural land (cf. Garscha-\ngen et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2010). A decline in agricultural\nland means a decline in rice growing areas as well (Fig. 4).\nHigh land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land\nhave forced farmers to practice agricultural intensiﬁcation. In\nthe RRD, rice production grew more than 25 % from 2000–\n2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

What are the potential negative impacts of the overuse of pesticides and high seeding densities in rice production in the Mekong River Delta?	The overuse of pesticides and high seeding densities in rice production in the Mekong River Delta can lead to several negative impacts. Firstly, the high pesticide use can result in pollution of the environment and lower the quality of rice sold for consumption due to the presence of high concentrations of pesticide residues. Secondly, pests such as the brown planthopper, which are not a threat at low densities, can multiply rapidly due to the constant supply of food from intensive rice production. This situation is worsened by asynchronous planting, which provides a continuous supply of rice plants throughout the year. Thirdly, the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers can increase the pests' reproductive potential. Fourthly, the excessive use of pesticides can kill the natural enemies of pests such as spiders, ants, bees, beetles, dragonflies, frogs, ladybugs, and wasps. This not only eliminates the natural predators of rice pests but also leads to the pests becoming resistant to the pesticides, requiring higher doses for effective control in the future. Lastly, the overuse of pesticides is also linked to insufficient knowledge of its proper use and aggressive marketing by agrochemical companies.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1479\ndue to intensiﬁed cropping practices involving the use of\nnew high yielding rice varieties, irrigation during the dry sea-\nson and high inputs of agrochemicals (Drebold, 2017; Mor-\nton, 2020).The high pesticide use was reﬂected in a study\nin Nam Dinh Province in the RRD, where 8 out of 12 tar-\nget pesticides were found in agricultural soils.In this study,\nfrequently detected pesticides include isoprothiolane, chlor-\npyrifos and propiconazole, and besides polluting the envi-\nronment, the presence of high concentrations of pesticide\nresidues also lowers the quality of rice sold for consumption\n(Braun et al., 2018; Fig.4).In general, pests such as the brown planthopper are nat-\nurally occurring and are not a threat at low densities.How-\never, intensive rice production with high seeding densities\nand the use of susceptible varieties create a constant sup-\nply of food, which allows their numbers to balloon.This is\nexacerbated by the asynchronous planting, which creates a\ncontinuous supply of rice plants throughout the year in the\nMekong River Delta.In addition, the overuse of nitrogen fer-\ntilizers increases the pests’ reproductive potential.Thirdly,\nthe excessive use of pesticides also kills the natural ene-\nmies of pests such as spiders, ants, bees, beetles, dragonﬂies,\nfrogs, ladybugs and wasps.Besides killing the natural preda-\ntors of rice pests, the pests targeted by the pesticides may also\nbecome resistant to the pesticide.As a result, higher doses of\nthe pesticide may be needed to kill them in the future.For\nexample, killing planthoppers now requires a pesticide dose\n500 times larger than was needed in the past (Normile, 2013).The overuse of pesticide is due to a combination of factors\nsuch as insufﬁcient knowledge of its proper use as well as\naggressive marketing by agrochemical companies (Bottrell\nand Schoenly, 2012; Normile, 2013; Sebesvari et al., 2011).The dashed lines in Fig.4 show that pesticide use may not\nnecessarily reduce the incidence of pests and diseases if ex-\ncessive volumes were applied.3.1.3 Dikes\nWet-season ﬂooding is a naturally occurring phenomenon\nin the two deltas of Vietnam (Chan et al., 2012, 2015).To\nfacilitate the planting of rice during the wet season, ﬂood\nprevention dikes were constructed to keep ﬂoodwaters out\n(Fig.5).The MRD has more than 13 000 km of ﬂood preven-\ntion dikes, of which 8000 km are low dikes below 2 m tall.These low dikes were mostly constructed before 2000 to de-\nlay the entry of ﬂoodwaters at the start of the monsoon season\nto allow two rice crops to be grown.A severe ﬂood in 2000\nprovided the impetus for river dikes to be heightened to 3.5 m\nto completely keep ﬂoodwaters out.These high dikes have\nfacilitated triple-cropping in the MRD, particularly in Dong\nThap and An Giang provinces (Chapman et al., 2016; Howie,\n2005; Le et al., 2018; Triet et al., 2017).However, the pres-\nence of high dikes in the MRD has reduced the supply of fer-\ntile alluvium, increasing the need for artiﬁcial fertilizers and\npesticides to maintain yields (Chapman et al., 2017; Fig.4).Figure 5.Example of a river dike for ﬂood control in Nam Dinh\nProvince in the Red River Delta.A study comparing sediment deposition in areas of high\nand low dikes in An Giang Province found that double-\ncropping farmers who cultivate their crops in areas with low\ndikes have an average of 2.5 cm of sediment deposition.This\ndeposition by ﬂoodwaters improved their average annual in-\nput efﬁciency by 0.3 t of yield per tonne of fertilizer.Con-\nversely, triple-cropping farmers had very little deposition, av-\neraging 0.5 cm as the high dikes kept ﬂoodwaters out.', '1478 K.

The context does not provide information on how the annual deposition of sediment-bound nutrients from floodwaters contributes to the fertilization needs of a rice crop season in the Mekong Delta.	['K. W.

V .Pham et al., 2018; Winkel et al., 2011), there is no re-\nsearch on (groundwater induced) land subsidence in the Red\nRiver Delta.Thus, the magnitude of land subsidence in the\ndelta is uncertain and should be an area for future research.3.2 Regional anthropogenic drivers\n3.2.1 Upstream dams\nThe Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau and\nﬂows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo-\ndia and southern Vietnam.To meet growing demands for\nelectricity, many small- and large-scale hydropower projects\nhave been commissioned in each country to take advantage\nof this supposedly green and clean source of energy (Nhan\nand Cao, 2019; Manh et al., 2015).A total of 241 dams\nhave been completed in the entire Mekong basin, with an-\nother 29 under construction.A further 91 are currently be-\ning planned.These 361 dams consist of 176 hydropower\ndams and 185 irrigation dams.Of the 364 dams in the\nMekong, 20 are in Vietnamese territory (WLE Mekong\nCGIAR, 2020a).Conversely, the Red River originates in\nYunnan Province in China and ﬂows towards northern Viet-\nnam.It is less heavily dammed, with a total of 105 dams in\nChina and Vietnam.There are 25 hydropower dams, 3 multi-\npurpose dams and 9 irrigation dams in the Red River basin in\nVietnam (Vinh et al., 2014; WLE Mekong CGIAR, 2020b).While there are no dams in the Mekong River Delta or the\nRed River Delta due to their relatively ﬂat elevation, up-\nstream dam development inﬂuences downstream regions in\nmany ways, with the environmental impacts extending far\nbeyond the dam itself (Kondolf et al., 2014).Firstly, a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel and\nsuspended sediment is impounded in reservoirs behind the\ndams instead of being transported downstream.This dimin-\nished sediment load may aggravate erosion downstream from\nthe dam (Nhan and Cao, 2019; Fig.4).Using a network\nmodel, under a “deﬁnitive future” scenario of 38 new dams,\nthe cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River\nDelta would be 51 %.Conversely, under full build-up of\n133 new dams, only 4 % of the pre-dam sediment load will\nreach the delta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Manh et al.(2015)\nalso reached similar conclusions with a quasi-2D hydrody-\nnamic model of suspended sediment dynamics.Floodplainsedimentation would decrease by about 21 % to 96 %, while\nsediment load supplied to the sea at the river will diminish by\n1 % to 95 %, with the extreme values representing full dam\nbuild-up.Even if dam construction was limited to the river\ntributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment\ntrapped could be as high as 68 %, meaning that only about\n32 % of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River\nDelta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Indeed, Binh et al.(2020) found that the suspended sed-\niment loads in the MRD had decreased by 74.1 % in 2012–\n2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang\ncascade in China.', 'In particular, the Manwan and Dachaoshan\ndams contributed to 32 % of the reduction.In addition,\nfrom 2014–2017, the average incision rate of the Tien River\nin the MRD was 3 times higher than the previously recorded\nvalue.Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of\n14.8 % of the annual riverbed incision, while the remainder\nwas caused by hydropower dams upstream.The deleterious impacts of dams on sediment loads can\nalso be found in the Red River Delta in spite of the smaller\nnumber of dams.While the Hoa Binh dam is located on a\ntributary of the Red River in Vietnam, its large size has in-\nﬂuenced suspended sediment distribution in the lower Red\nRiver basin.For example, an analysis of the suspended sedi-\nment concentration over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010\nshowed that yearly suspended sediment ﬂux had dropped by\n61 % at Son Tay near Hanoi (Vinh et al., 2014).Similarly,\nDuc et al.(2012) calculated that the suspended sediment bud-\nget at Son Tay and Hanoi hydrological monitoring stations\nwas reduced by 56 % after the Hoa Binh dam became oper-\national in 1989.The reduction in sediment loads at the Red\nRiver Delta would likewise have a similar impact on delta\nsize and rice growing areas.Besides a change in sediment loads, dams also alter stream\ndischarge and water levels, with concurrent effects on wa-\nter supplies (not shown in Fig.4).When water levels are\nhigh during the rainy season, dams can be used to impound\nthe excess water in the reservoir behind.During the dry sea-\nson, when water levels are lower, the dams can release wa-\nter downstream.In doing so, dams increase dry-season dis-\ncharge and decrease wet-season discharge.The modiﬁcation\nof seasonal water ﬂows is problematic as changes in natu-\nral ﬂow patterns, such as higher ﬂows in the dry season and\nlower ﬂows in the wet season, would affect rice production\nas rice growing calendars are currently linked to the natu-\nral ﬂuctuations in high and low ﬂows (Robert, 2017).Hence,\nchanges in water levels due to anthropogenic interventions\nmay create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if plant-\ning calendars remain unchanged.In addition, lowered water\nlevels during dry seasons due to upstream water impound-\nment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion and create\nunfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021']
What are the impacts of sand mining on the frequency of flooding and soil fertility in the Mekong Delta, and how might this affect rice agriculture?	Sand mining in the Mekong Delta has significant impacts on the frequency of flooding and soil fertility. The extraction of large quantities of riverbed sediments creates pits and pools that trap sediments from upstream, preventing them from traveling downstream and contributing to the delta's growth. This process also results in bed incision, leading to land loss which threatens rice growing areas. Moreover, aggressive sand mining disrupts natural flooding. A study found that flood frequency in the Mekong River Delta dropped by 7.8% from 2005–2015 due to the lowering of the riverbed. This disruption in flood regimes results in reduced volumes of water and sediments for agricultural production. Floodwaters typically deposit fertile sediments while flushing out pesticides and fertilizers accumulated from intensive agricultural production. When the flood frequency decreases, the frequency at which farmlands benefit from this natural soil quality enhancement also decreases. Consequently, soil fertility may decrease over time, leading to declines in rice yields unless artificial fertilizers are added.	['1480 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nLikewise, the RRD is also heavily diked, with 3000 km of\nriver dikes (Fig.5), but unlike the MRD, high dikes are ab-\nsent (Pilarcyzk and Nguyen, 2005).Besides river and ﬂood\ncontrol dikes, there are also sea dikes and salinization pre-\nvention dikes in both deltas to protect the area from salinity\nintrusion.There are 1500 km of sea and estuary dikes in the\nRRD.In the MRD, there are 1290 km of salinization preven-\ntion dikes and 450 km of sea dikes (Le et al., 2018; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005; Fig.4).3.1.4 Sand mining\nSand mining is carried out on a large scale in the Mekong\n(Kondolf et al., 2018).Fueled by demand from reclamation,\nexport and construction, 55.2 million tonnes of sediment\nwas extracted from the Mekong main stem in Laos, Thai-\nland, Cambodia and Vietnam from 2011 to 2012 (Bravard\nand Gaillot, 2013; Robert, 2017).A more recent analysis of\nbathymetric maps and the local reﬁlling processes by Jor-\ndan et al.(2019) put the amount of sand extracted from the\nMekong River Delta in 2018 at 17.77 Mm3.Besides removing large quantities of riverbed sediments,\nsand mining operations have created numerous pits and\npools.These pits and pools, which can be up to 45 m deep,\nthen become sediment traps, trapping bed loads from up-\nstream reaches and preventing them from traveling down-\nstream and contributing to the continued presence and\ngrowth of the delta.In addition, bed incision also occurs\nas the water is sediment-starved.The down-cutting of river-\nbanks can propagate upstream and downstream from the ex-\ntraction sites for many kilometers, in turn affecting river\necosystems over a large area (Kondolf et al., 2018).This bank\nincision results in land loss, which threatens rice growing ar-\neas (Fig.4).Aggressive sand mining also disrupts natural ﬂooding.A\nrecent study of the effects of riverine mining on ﬂood fre-\nquency in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle (LXQ) in the Mekong\nRiver Delta found that ﬂood frequency had dropped by 7.8 %\nfrom 2005–2015.Water levels at local gauge stations also\nshowed an overall decreasing trend, indicating that the low-\nering of the riverbed had reduced the frequency of ﬂooding.Disrupted ﬂood regimes result in reduced volumes of water\nand sediments for agricultural production.In addition, ﬂood-\nwaters typically deposit fertile sediments while ﬂushing the\npesticides and fertilizers accumulated from intensive agricul-\ntural production.When the ﬂood frequency decreases, the\nfrequency at which farmlands beneﬁt from this natural soil\nquality enhancement decreases.Consequently, soil fertility\nmay decrease over time and lead to declines in rice yields un-\nless artiﬁcial fertilizers are added (Park et al., 2020; Fig.4).While there are several studies on the diffuse, yet insidious\nnature of sand mining in the Mekong (cf.Bravard and Gail-\nlot, 2013; Brunier et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2019; Kondolf\net al., 2018; Park et al., 2020; Robert, 2017; Schmitt et al.,\n2017), the extent of sand mining in the Red River Delta isunclear as there is almost no research on this issue.We did\nhowever come across an article in a Vietnamese newspaper\nabout rampant sand mining in the Red River and how min-\ning operations have caused erosion in nearby villages (Chinh,\n2018).Similar to the situation in the MRD, the authorities\nhave turned a blind eye to this illegal business (Bravard and\nGaillot, 2013; Chinh, 2018).3.1.5 Groundwater extraction\nAnother example of an anthropogenic development creating\nother interrelated problems is that of groundwater extraction.', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

"""How has the increased groundwater extraction affected the severity of saltwater intrusion and the suitability of land for rice cultivation in the Mekong River Delta?"""	The increased groundwater extraction in the Mekong River Delta has exacerbated land subsidence, which in turn has amplified the severity and extent of saltwater intrusion. This process has also reduced the suitability of land for rice cultivation. The subsidence rates from groundwater extraction were found to be between 1.1 and 2.5 cm per year. Over 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 resulted in an average of 18 cm of subsidence, with some areas experiencing over 30 cm of subsidence. This land subsidence, caused by excessive groundwater extraction, increases the vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and reduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.	['While groundwater extraction has increased the availability\nof water for human activities, it has exacerbated land subsi-\ndence, which has increased the severity and extent of salt-\nwater intrusion and reduced the suitability of land for rice\ncultivation (Fig.4).Minderhoud et al.(2017) developed a\n3D numerical groundwater ﬂow model of the MRD surface\nand found that subsidence rates from groundwater extraction\nwere between 1.1 and 2.5 cm yr−1.The model also showed\nthat 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 had re-\nsulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence, with\nsome hotspots recording over 30 cm of subsidence.Land sub-\nsidence from excessive groundwater extraction acts as a cat-\nalyst that increases vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and\nreduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.Moreover, rice crops become contaminated with arsenic\nwhen arsenic-rich groundwater used for non-agricultural use\nis discharged into rivers, and the river water is used for rice ir-\nrigation (Lan and Giao, 2017; Minderhoud et al., 2018).High\narsenic concentrations in groundwater seem to be of natu-\nral origin.In the Mekong River Delta, naturally occurring\nbiochemical and hydrological processes cause As to be re-\nleased from Fe oxides in rocks and sediments into groundwa-\nter reservoirs (Fendorf et al., 2010).In addition, deep ground-\nwater extraction causes interbedded clays to compact and ex-\npel water containing dissolved As (Erban et al., 2013).Crop\nquality is reduced when the arsenic-enriched water is de-\nposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth\n(Rahman and Hasegawa, 2011; Fig.4).Similarly, prevalence of groundwater extraction is also\nhigh in the Red River Delta.Approximately 70 % of the\npopulation living in the RRD accesses water from Holocene\nand Pleistocene aquifers (Berg et al., 2007; Winkel et al.,\n2011).Groundwater in the Red River Delta is also contam-\ninated with high levels of As due to reductive dissolution\nof As from iron oxyhydroxides in buried sediment (Berg et\nal., 2007; Luu, 2019).Berg et al.(2007) sampled 196 tube\nwells randomly over a 700 km2area in the Red River Delta,\nand the concentrations of As in groundwater ranged from\n1 to 3050 µg L−1, with an average of 159 µg L−1.Separately,\nWinkel et al.(2011) collected 512 water samples from pri-\nvate wells in the Red River ﬂoodplain and found As concen-\ntrations varying from <0.1 to 810 µg L−1, with 27 % of the\nsamples exceeding the WHO guideline value of 10 µg L−1.Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K.

What is the impact of upstream dam development on the sediment load reaching the Mekong River Delta and how might this affect erosion in the region?	Upstream dam development can significantly reduce the sediment load reaching the Mekong River Delta. For instance, under a scenario of 38 new dams, the cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River Delta could be 51%. If 133 new dams were built, only 4% of the pre-dam sediment load would reach the delta. This diminished sediment load could exacerbate erosion downstream from the dam. Even if dam construction was limited to the river tributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment trapped could be as high as 68%, meaning that only about 32% of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River Delta.	['In particular, the Manwan and Dachaoshan\ndams contributed to 32 % of the reduction.In addition,\nfrom 2014–2017, the average incision rate of the Tien River\nin the MRD was 3 times higher than the previously recorded\nvalue.Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of\n14.8 % of the annual riverbed incision, while the remainder\nwas caused by hydropower dams upstream.The deleterious impacts of dams on sediment loads can\nalso be found in the Red River Delta in spite of the smaller\nnumber of dams.While the Hoa Binh dam is located on a\ntributary of the Red River in Vietnam, its large size has in-\nﬂuenced suspended sediment distribution in the lower Red\nRiver basin.For example, an analysis of the suspended sedi-\nment concentration over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010\nshowed that yearly suspended sediment ﬂux had dropped by\n61 % at Son Tay near Hanoi (Vinh et al., 2014).Similarly,\nDuc et al.(2012) calculated that the suspended sediment bud-\nget at Son Tay and Hanoi hydrological monitoring stations\nwas reduced by 56 % after the Hoa Binh dam became oper-\national in 1989.The reduction in sediment loads at the Red\nRiver Delta would likewise have a similar impact on delta\nsize and rice growing areas.Besides a change in sediment loads, dams also alter stream\ndischarge and water levels, with concurrent effects on wa-\nter supplies (not shown in Fig.4).When water levels are\nhigh during the rainy season, dams can be used to impound\nthe excess water in the reservoir behind.During the dry sea-\nson, when water levels are lower, the dams can release wa-\nter downstream.In doing so, dams increase dry-season dis-\ncharge and decrease wet-season discharge.The modiﬁcation\nof seasonal water ﬂows is problematic as changes in natu-\nral ﬂow patterns, such as higher ﬂows in the dry season and\nlower ﬂows in the wet season, would affect rice production\nas rice growing calendars are currently linked to the natu-\nral ﬂuctuations in high and low ﬂows (Robert, 2017).Hence,\nchanges in water levels due to anthropogenic interventions\nmay create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if plant-\ning calendars remain unchanged.In addition, lowered water\nlevels during dry seasons due to upstream water impound-\nment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion and create\nunfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'K.

"""How do changes in water levels due to dams and other human interventions potentially increase saltwater intrusion and create unfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers in the Mekong Delta?"""	Changes in water levels due to dams and other human interventions can potentially increase saltwater intrusion and create unfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers in the Mekong Delta in several ways. Upstream dams can affect sediment accumulation as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, which impacts the fertility of the soil. Groundwater extraction can cause land subsidence, which in turn can lead to saltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, negatively affecting rice growing areas and the quality of rice produced. Additionally, anthropogenic developments like dikes, while designed to keep floodwaters and salt intrusion out, can result in a reduction in fertile silt deposits. Furthermore, climate change can exacerbate the effects of natural hazards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters, which can intensify problems such as excessive saltwater flooding and saltwater intrusion.

Based on the 2015-2016 drought in the Mekong Delta, how did salinity intrusion affect the rice crops in the region?	The context does not provide specific information on how the 2015-2016 drought in the Mekong Delta affected the rice crops in the region due to salinity intrusion.	['K. W.

How does saltwater flooding during a typhoon affect rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	Saltwater flooding during a typhoon can adversely affect rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. This is because rice is not adapted to withstand prolonged submergence and/or saline conditions. The saltwater flooding may reduce the rice growing areas, leading to a decrease in overall rice production.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1483\nIn terms of growth stage, rice plants at the tillering stage are\nmore likely to succumb to submergence than those at the veg-\netative stage.Plants fully submerged for short durations (2 d)\nalso had lower chances of survival than those that were par-\ntially submerged in ﬂoodwaters for longer durations (up to\n8 d).As such the effect of ﬂooding on rice growing areas is\nvariable as other factors that affect crop mortality include the\ntype of rice grown, the stage of rice growth, and the depth\nand length of submergence in ﬂoodwaters (Fig.6).Although severe ﬂooding can disrupt agricultural activi-\nties, moderate levels of freshwater ﬂooding bring beneﬁts\nto (rural) farmers (EEPSEA, 2011).Floodwaters from rivers\nimprove agricultural productivity by depositing nutrient-rich\nﬂood sediments on agricultural soils (Chapman et al., 2016).In addition, ﬂoods wash away contaminants, purify and\nrecharge aquifers, kill pests, and mitigate saltwater intrusion\n(EEPSEA, 2011; Hoang et al., 2018; Fig.6).Aquatic re-\nsources such as ﬁsh, crabs and snails also come in with the\nﬂoodwaters, which local farmers can collect to supplement\ntheir incomes.Besides growing rice, it is also possible to cul-\ntivate vegetables, ﬁsh, prawns and ducks in the ﬂooded ﬁelds\n(Nguyen and James, 2013).Towards the end of the ﬂooding\nseason and the start of the rice cultivation season, ﬂoodwa-\nters provide the water needed to start growing rice (Hoa et\nal., 2008).While there are investments in ﬂood prevention measures\nwith the construction and upgrading of river dikes, the con-\nstruction and dredging of reservoirs and drainage canals, and\nthe raising of roads and embankments, recent ﬂoods have\ncaused substantial agricultural losses as current measures\nhave proven to be inadequate (Hoa et al., 2008; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005).In 2018, 39 000 ha of rice in the RRD\nwas inundated by heavy rains and ﬂoods triggered by Ty-\nphoon Son-Tinh (VNA, 2018a).Similarly, due to a lack of\nembankments and/or poor construction and maintenance of\nexisting embankments, more than 2000 ha of rice was lost\nduring the annual ﬂoods in 2018.An Giang Province was the\nworst-affected, losing 1270 ha of rice (VNA, 2018b).3.3.3 Typhoons\nTyphoons are the most severe natural hazard that affects Viet-\nnam.When a typhoon occurs, affected areas are exposed to\nstrong winds of up to 50 m/s and up to 300 mm of rainfall\nin a day.As the rainy season in Vietnam coincides with the\ntyphoon season, widespread ﬂooding can be expected from\nheavy rain and overﬂowing rivers (CCFSC, 2005; Mai et\nal., 2009; K.-A.Nguyen et al., 2019).Storm surges can also\noccur when high winds pushing on the ocean’s surface are\ncombined with the effect of low pressure in the center of\na typhoon (Takagi et al., 2013).A study of typhoon disas-\nters in Vietnam since 1950 showed that half of the 450 ty-\nphoons recorded during the study period were accompanied\nby a storm surge of over 1 m, and 11 % were over 2.5 m high\n(Imamura and Van To, 1997).In the Red River Delta, Quynhet al.(1998) found that the maximum storm surge is usually\nbetween 1 to 1.5 m a.m.s.l.(above mean sea level).In short,\nrice production will be adversely affected by strong winds\nand widespread ﬂooding from heavy precipitation and storm\nsurges in the event of a typhoon.Saltwater ﬂooding may re-\nduce rice growing areas as rice is not adapted to withstand\nprolonged submergence and/or saline conditions.', '1482 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 6. Flow diagram showing the natural hazards that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. Local drivers refer to\nnatural hazards that occur within the two mega-deltas. Although sea level rise has implications on a local scale, it is considered a global\ndriver as it occurs on a global scale. The effect of ﬂooding on rice growing areas is variable as other factors that affect crop mortality include\nthe type of rice grown, the stage of rice growth, and the depth and length of submergence in ﬂoodwaters.\n3.3 Local natural-hazard drivers\n3.3.1 Drought\nDroughts do not result solely from a lack of rainfall; they\ncan also result from changes in the arrival of rains and the\nlength of the wet season (Adamson and Bird, 2010; Lassa et\nal., 2016). Vietnam was affected by droughts in 1997–1998,\n2002–2003, 2009–2010 and most recently in 2015–2016.\nThe 2015–2016 drought was the most severe in 90 years\n(Grosjean et al., 2016). All 13 provinces in the Mekong River\nDelta were affected by the 2015 drought. Besides a lack of\nwater for irrigation, the drought caused saltwater to intrude\nup to 70 km inland. Cumulatively, the drought and accompa-\nnying saltwater intrusion damaged 400 000 ha of rice crops,\nincluding 50 000 ha of paddy in Kien Giang and Ca Mau\nprovinces in the MRD (Grosjean et al., 2016; Nguyen, 2017).\nAlthough there is no research on how droughts and salinity\nintrusion have affected rice quality in Vietnam, research from\nelsewhere has shown that water shortages and salt stress in-\nduce physiochemical alterations which affect the rice grains\nproduced (Pandey et al., 2014; Razzaq et al., 2019; Fig. 6).\nCompared to the MRD, research and reports on droughts\nin the Red River Delta are scarce. The UNW-DPC (2014)reported that the RRD experienced droughts from the end\nof 1998 to April 1999, which affected 86 140 ha of rice. An-\nother drought occurred from January to February 2004, with\nthe water level of the Red River at the lowest in 40 years. Low\nwater levels were also reported in 2010; however drought\nconditions and saltwater intrusion were more severe in the\nMRD (Overland, 2010). The effect of droughts on rice agri-\nculture – reduced yields from a lack of water and salinity\nintrusion – would also be similar in the RRD.\n3.3.2 Freshwater ﬂooding\nRanked as the second most severe natural hazard after ty-\nphoons, freshwater ﬂoods are caused by overﬂowing rivers or\nheavy monsoonal rains or associated with heavy rain from ty-\nphoons (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Hung et al., 2012; McElwee\net al., 2017). Theoretically, ﬂooding reduces rice growing ar-\neas, but it is simplistic to assume that ﬂooded ﬁelds result in\nimmediate loss of rice crops. A study by Kotera et al. (2005)\nin the RRD showed that the type of rice, stage of rice growth,\nand lengths and depths of submergence were factors that in-\nﬂuence the survival rates of rice crops. For example, the local\nvariety Moc Tuyen was less resilient to submergence than\nthe two other genetically improved high-yielding varieties.\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Based on the context, how does the timing and location of a typhoon's landfall affect the extent of damage to rice crops in Vietnam?	The extent of damage to rice crops in Vietnam due to a typhoon is influenced by the timing and location of the typhoon's landfall. If a typhoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods, the agricultural losses can be significant. The landfall location also plays a crucial role. For instance, Typhoon Mirinae (2016) made landfall in Nam Dinh, damaging or submerging a large area of rice, while Typhoon Nesat (2011) made landfall in Hai Phong with a similar intensity but caused significantly less damage. Furthermore, the Mekong River Delta is less prone to typhoons, but when they do occur, they can cause significant damage.	['Addition-\nally, strong winds damage rice plants, with both effects con-\ntributing to a reduction in rice yields (Fig.6).Although a stronger typhoon usually brings higher wind\nspeeds, more rainfall, larger waves and higher storm surges\n(Larson et al., 2014), the quantity of agricultural losses de-\npends on factors such as landfall location(s) and whether the\ntyphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting\nperiods (Masutomi et al., 2012).For example, Typhoon Miri-\nnae (2016), which made landfall in Nam Dinh as a tropical\nstorm, damaged or submerged 225 216 ha of rice.Meanwhile\nTyphoon Nesat (2011) made landfall in Hai Phong with a\nsimilar intensity and caused only 3500 ha of rice damage.Conversely, Typhoon Kalmai (2014) made landfall in Quang\nNinh as a slightly stronger category 1 storm and caused\n20 000 ha of rice damage (Nhân Dân, 2014; United Nations\nVietnam, 2016; Viêt Nam News, 2011).An average of ﬁve to six typhoons affect Vietnam be-\ntween June and November every year (Larson et al., 2014;\nNguyen et al., 2007).Typhoon activity shifts from the north\nto the south as the year progresses.Therefore, peak activ-\nity in the north and southern part of Vietnam is in August\nand November, respectively (Imamura and Van To, 1997).We reviewed the Digital Typhoon (2021) database and found\n303 typhoons that came within 500 km of Vietnam’s coast-\nline from 1995 to 2018.A total of 29 cyclones made their\ninitial landfall in the Red River Delta, while only 4 cyclones\nmade landfall in the Mekong River Delta during the study pe-\nriod – one each in 1973, 1996, 1997 and 2006 (unpublished\nresults).Although the MRD is less prone to typhoons, two\nof the most recent typhoons caused signiﬁcant damage de-\nspite each being classiﬁed as a tropical storm upon landfall.Typhoon Linda (1997) caused some 349 232 ha of rice to be\nsubmerged, while Typhoon Durian (2006) damaged 6978 ha\nof agricultural land (International Federation of Red Cross\nand Red Crescent Society, 2006; UN Department of Human-\nitarian Affairs, 1997).Lastly, typhoons may not necessarily be bad all the time.Darby et al.(2016) combined suspended sediment load data\nfrom the Mekong River with hydrological model simulations\nto examine the role of typhoons in transporting suspended\nsediments and found that one-third (32 %) of the suspended\nsediment reaching the delta is delivered by runoff generated\nby rainfall associated with typhoons.When a typhoon affects\nareas upstream, the land receives higher-than-usual levels of\nrainfall, which may trigger landslides.This sediment can be\ntransferred into rivers and delivered downstream.While the\nrole of tropical typhoons in sediment mobilization is unclear\ngiven the lack of research in this area, such ﬁndings have\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'K.

"""What are the potential impacts of rising sea levels due to climate change on rice production and food security in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?"""	Rising sea levels due to climate change could have significant impacts on rice production and food security in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Sea level rise could reduce the recurrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m height to once every 49 years. This could lead to breaches in inadequately constructed and poorly maintained dikes and embankments, resulting in saltwater flooding that damages rice growing areas. Additionally, rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction could cause large portions of the low-lying regions to be inundated and flooded. This could facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients. Salinity intrusion is expected to worsen during the dry season, affecting approximately 1.8 million hectares in the Mekong Delta, of which 1.3 million hectares is affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1. This area is predicted to increase to 2.2 million hectares with rising sea levels. Increased soil salinization could lead to a loss of land available for rice production. While there are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices in place to reduce incursions of seawater, they may be inadequate if not well maintained and upgraded. Therefore, the impacts of rising sea levels could negatively affect rice productivity and food security in the region.	['Chan, F. K. S., Friess, D. A., Terry, J.

"""What are the potential impacts of rising sea levels and increased salinity on rice production in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam?"""	Rising sea levels and increased salinity can have significant impacts on rice production in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. Sea level rise could reduce the recurrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m height to once every 49 years. This could lead to breaches in dikes and embankments, resulting in saltwater flooding that damages rice growing areas. Additionally, rising sea levels combined with accelerated coastal subsidence due to excessive groundwater extraction could cause large portions of the low-lying areas to be flooded. This could facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients. Salinity intrusion is expected to worsen during the dry season. Approximately 1.8 million hectares in the Mekong Delta region is already affected by dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million hectares is affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1. This area is predicted to increase to 2.2 million hectares with rising sea levels. Increased soil salinization could lead to a loss of land available for rice production. Existing sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices may be inadequate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.

"""What are the potential impacts of salinity intrusion on rice production in the Mekong Delta, and how might climate change exacerbate these effects?"""	Salinity intrusion can have detrimental effects on rice production in the Mekong Delta. It can lead to a reduction in the quality and quantity of rice produced. Climate change could exacerbate these effects by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as typhoons and sea level rise, which can induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion. Droughts, which may also become more frequent due to climate change, can worsen the extent of salinity intrusion due to a lack of fresh water. Furthermore, climate change could potentially reduce rice growing areas in the future due to a substantial reduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams, coupled with the process of land subsidence from groundwater extraction and rising sea levels.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', 'Chan, F.

What are the potential negative impacts of converting paddy fields to shrimp ponds in terms of soil salinity and availability of fresh water in the Mekong Delta?	The conversion of paddy fields to shrimp ponds can increase soil salinity and reduce the availability of fresh water. Over time, this can make it difficult for neighboring farmers who have not switched to aquaculture to plant rice, forcing them to seek alternative livelihoods. Additionally, the environmental conditions in these rice-shrimp systems can be suboptimal, contributing to low yields and survival. For instance, water temperature and salinity can be too high in the dry season, and dissolved oxygen too low, causing most shrimps to die. For rice, the high soil salinity caused by the aquaculture pond can be a major limitation.	['1486 K. W.

"""What are the impacts of land-use patterns and natural hazards on rice agriculture in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam, and how have these factors affected the demand for aquaculture and alternative crops?"""	Land-use patterns and natural hazards have significant impacts on rice agriculture in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam. Environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion has also reduced rice growing areas. However, agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high despite shrinking growing areas. The construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields, but these dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. In terms of demand for aquaculture and alternative crops, higher prices and rising demand for these products have incentivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture. The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong River Delta provinces and caused significant agriculture- and aquaculture-related damage, further influencing the shift towards alternative crops and aquaculture. Despite official encouragement to move away from triple-cropping, most farmers have largely ignored this directive as they preferred to earn money from the additional rice crop. Overall, these factors have led to a decrease in rice growing areas, but an increase in the demand for aquaculture and alternative crops.	['1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.', 'However, a study by\nTran and Weger (2018) in An Giang Province revealed that\ndespite ofﬁcial encouragement to move away from triple-\ncropping, most farmers have largely ignored the directive as\nthey preferred to earn money from the additional rice crop.In addition, many of them felt that the beneﬁts of ﬂooding\nthe land were minimal as upstream dams have drastically re-\nduced fertile sediment and ﬁsh.Evidently, farmers are will-\ning to make changes to their farming practices only if it ben-\neﬁts them.To mitigate “wicked” environmental challenges, there is\na need for holistic land-use planning and soft measures\n(e.g., implementing crop and land-use change) on top of\nhard engineering structures.Previously, management options\nto increase agricultural productivity and mitigate the threats\nposed by natural hazards were largely characterized by hard\noptions such as the construction of dikes, sea walls and sluice\ngates.These were typically top-down projects spearheaded\nby the local government (Neumann et al., 2015; Smajgl et\nal., 2015).While highly visible engineering structures are\neasily constructed and generally effective, unwanted side ef-\nfects may be created.For example, ﬂooding and sediment\nexclusion were some problems that were inadvertently cre-\nated due to the presence of high dikes.In the long term,\n(costly) maintenance is needed to maintain the functional-\nity of engineered structures (Hoang et al., 2018; Neumann\net al., 2015).In addition, during the pre-construction phase,\nnatural vegetation may be cleared (Geist and Lambin, 2002).Adopting a systems-thinking approach would allow policy-\nmakers and managers to situate the range of mitigation mea-\nsures within broader environmental processes.In doing so, a\nclearer view of the possibilities and challenges present in an\nera of widespread anthropogenic development and changing\nclimates is provided.5 Conclusions\nThe focus of this paper is on the impacts of land-use patterns\nand natural hazards on rice agriculture in the Mekong and\nRed River deltas in Vietnam.While we focused on rice agri-\nculture, these two deltas, like many other deltas worldwide,\nare also major production hubs for fruits and vegetables (Day\net al., 2016; Nhan and Cao, 2019).Hence, the natural hazards\nand anthropogenic factors listed will have an effect on other\nagricultural produce as well.A key ﬁnding is that demand for aquaculture and alterna-\ntive crops and urban expansion has diminished rice growing\nareas.The problem of shrinking agricultural land is amelio-\nrated by agricultural intensiﬁcation, which has increased land\nefﬁciency.However, widespread agrochemical use causes\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021']
"""How do human activities and natural hazards, such as typhoons and sea level rise, contribute to saltwater flooding and worsen salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how might these issues be exacerbated by climate change?"""	Human activities such as the construction of dikes and dams, sand mining, and groundwater extraction can have significant impacts on the environment, which in turn can contribute to saltwater flooding and worsen salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta. Dikes are designed to keep out floodwaters and salt intrusion, but they also reduce fertile silt deposits. Sand mining increases channel erosion and reduces the frequency of natural freshwater flooding. Upstream dams trap sediments in reservoirs, affecting sediment accumulation. Groundwater extraction can cause land subsidence, saltwater intrusion, and arsenic contamination, all of which negatively impact rice growing areas and the quality of rice produced.Natural hazards like typhoons and sea level rise can amplify these problems. Typhoons can induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion. Sea level rise, coupled with the process of land subsidence from groundwater extraction, can potentially reduce rice growing areas in the future. Climate change may exacerbate these issues by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters. This could intensify problems such as excessive saltwater flooding and saltwater intrusion. For instance, sea level rise could reduce the recurrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge, leading to more frequent saltwater flooding. Rising sea levels, along with accelerated coastal subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction, could cause large portions of the low-lying Mekong Delta to be inundated and flooded, facilitating the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers and increasing salinity gradients.

Decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise can have significant impacts on the survival of the Mekong Delta.

Based on the context, what are the potential impacts of river-bed mining on the destabilisation of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	River-bed mining, specifically sand mining, in the Mekong Delta has several destabilizing effects. Large quantities of riverbed sediments are removed, creating numerous pits and pools that can be up to 45 meters deep. These pits and pools act as sediment traps, preventing sediments from traveling downstream and contributing to the delta's growth. This process also leads to bed incision, where the riverbanks are cut down due to sediment-starved water. This can propagate upstream and downstream from the extraction sites, affecting river ecosystems over a large area and resulting in land loss, which threatens rice growing areas. Moreover, aggressive sand mining disrupts natural flooding. A study found that flood frequency in the Mekong River Delta dropped by 7.8% from 2005–2015 due to riverine mining. This disruption in flood regimes results in reduced volumes of water and sediments for agricultural production. Floodwaters typically deposit fertile sediments and flush out accumulated pesticides and fertilizers from intensive agricultural production. When flood frequency decreases, the frequency at which farmlands benefit from this natural soil quality enhancement also decreases. This could lead to a decrease in soil fertility over time and result in declines in rice yields unless artificial fertilizers are added.	['1480 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nLikewise, the RRD is also heavily diked, with 3000 km of\nriver dikes (Fig.5), but unlike the MRD, high dikes are ab-\nsent (Pilarcyzk and Nguyen, 2005).Besides river and ﬂood\ncontrol dikes, there are also sea dikes and salinization pre-\nvention dikes in both deltas to protect the area from salinity\nintrusion.There are 1500 km of sea and estuary dikes in the\nRRD.In the MRD, there are 1290 km of salinization preven-\ntion dikes and 450 km of sea dikes (Le et al., 2018; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005; Fig.4).3.1.4 Sand mining\nSand mining is carried out on a large scale in the Mekong\n(Kondolf et al., 2018).Fueled by demand from reclamation,\nexport and construction, 55.2 million tonnes of sediment\nwas extracted from the Mekong main stem in Laos, Thai-\nland, Cambodia and Vietnam from 2011 to 2012 (Bravard\nand Gaillot, 2013; Robert, 2017).A more recent analysis of\nbathymetric maps and the local reﬁlling processes by Jor-\ndan et al.(2019) put the amount of sand extracted from the\nMekong River Delta in 2018 at 17.77 Mm3.Besides removing large quantities of riverbed sediments,\nsand mining operations have created numerous pits and\npools.These pits and pools, which can be up to 45 m deep,\nthen become sediment traps, trapping bed loads from up-\nstream reaches and preventing them from traveling down-\nstream and contributing to the continued presence and\ngrowth of the delta.In addition, bed incision also occurs\nas the water is sediment-starved.The down-cutting of river-\nbanks can propagate upstream and downstream from the ex-\ntraction sites for many kilometers, in turn affecting river\necosystems over a large area (Kondolf et al., 2018).This bank\nincision results in land loss, which threatens rice growing ar-\neas (Fig.4).Aggressive sand mining also disrupts natural ﬂooding.A\nrecent study of the effects of riverine mining on ﬂood fre-\nquency in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle (LXQ) in the Mekong\nRiver Delta found that ﬂood frequency had dropped by 7.8 %\nfrom 2005–2015.Water levels at local gauge stations also\nshowed an overall decreasing trend, indicating that the low-\nering of the riverbed had reduced the frequency of ﬂooding.Disrupted ﬂood regimes result in reduced volumes of water\nand sediments for agricultural production.In addition, ﬂood-\nwaters typically deposit fertile sediments while ﬂushing the\npesticides and fertilizers accumulated from intensive agricul-\ntural production.When the ﬂood frequency decreases, the\nfrequency at which farmlands beneﬁt from this natural soil\nquality enhancement decreases.Consequently, soil fertility\nmay decrease over time and lead to declines in rice yields un-\nless artiﬁcial fertilizers are added (Park et al., 2020; Fig.4).While there are several studies on the diffuse, yet insidious\nnature of sand mining in the Mekong (cf.Bravard and Gail-\nlot, 2013; Brunier et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2019; Kondolf\net al., 2018; Park et al., 2020; Robert, 2017; Schmitt et al.,\n2017), the extent of sand mining in the Red River Delta isunclear as there is almost no research on this issue.We did\nhowever come across an article in a Vietnamese newspaper\nabout rampant sand mining in the Red River and how min-\ning operations have caused erosion in nearby villages (Chinh,\n2018).Similar to the situation in the MRD, the authorities\nhave turned a blind eye to this illegal business (Bravard and\nGaillot, 2013; Chinh, 2018).3.1.5 Groundwater extraction\nAnother example of an anthropogenic development creating\nother interrelated problems is that of groundwater extraction.', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

"""What are the sustainable adaptation strategies for rice agriculture in the Mekong Delta's An Giang Province, Vietnam, in the face of climate change and flood risks?"""	The sustainable adaptation strategies for rice agriculture in the Mekong Delta's An Giang Province, Vietnam, in the face of climate change and flood risks include the use of system dynamics modelling to evaluate the sustainability of these strategies. Additionally, there has been a focus on sustainable rice cultivation in the deep flooded zones of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Another approach has been to consider the trade-offs between adaptation and development, particularly in relation to fluvial sediment deposition and the sustainability of rice-cropping.	['Chan, F. K.

What are the potential impacts of pumping-induced land subsidence on the release of arsenic to deep groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, as mentioned in the report?	Pumping-induced land subsidence in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, can increase the vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and reduce the availability of land suitable for rice production. This is due to the fact that excessive groundwater extraction can lead to land subsidence. Furthermore, when arsenic-rich groundwater, used for non-agricultural purposes, is discharged into rivers and used for rice irrigation, it can contaminate the rice crops with arsenic. This is because high arsenic concentrations in groundwater, which seem to be of natural origin, are released from iron oxides in rocks and sediments into groundwater reservoirs due to naturally occurring biochemical and hydrological processes. Additionally, deep groundwater extraction can cause interbedded clays to compact and expel water containing dissolved arsenic. This can reduce crop quality when the arsenic-enriched water is deposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth.	['While groundwater extraction has increased the availability\nof water for human activities, it has exacerbated land subsi-\ndence, which has increased the severity and extent of salt-\nwater intrusion and reduced the suitability of land for rice\ncultivation (Fig.4).Minderhoud et al.(2017) developed a\n3D numerical groundwater ﬂow model of the MRD surface\nand found that subsidence rates from groundwater extraction\nwere between 1.1 and 2.5 cm yr−1.The model also showed\nthat 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 had re-\nsulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence, with\nsome hotspots recording over 30 cm of subsidence.Land sub-\nsidence from excessive groundwater extraction acts as a cat-\nalyst that increases vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and\nreduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.Moreover, rice crops become contaminated with arsenic\nwhen arsenic-rich groundwater used for non-agricultural use\nis discharged into rivers, and the river water is used for rice ir-\nrigation (Lan and Giao, 2017; Minderhoud et al., 2018).High\narsenic concentrations in groundwater seem to be of natu-\nral origin.In the Mekong River Delta, naturally occurring\nbiochemical and hydrological processes cause As to be re-\nleased from Fe oxides in rocks and sediments into groundwa-\nter reservoirs (Fendorf et al., 2010).In addition, deep ground-\nwater extraction causes interbedded clays to compact and ex-\npel water containing dissolved As (Erban et al., 2013).Crop\nquality is reduced when the arsenic-enriched water is de-\nposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth\n(Rahman and Hasegawa, 2011; Fig.4).Similarly, prevalence of groundwater extraction is also\nhigh in the Red River Delta.Approximately 70 % of the\npopulation living in the RRD accesses water from Holocene\nand Pleistocene aquifers (Berg et al., 2007; Winkel et al.,\n2011).Groundwater in the Red River Delta is also contam-\ninated with high levels of As due to reductive dissolution\nof As from iron oxyhydroxides in buried sediment (Berg et\nal., 2007; Luu, 2019).Berg et al.(2007) sampled 196 tube\nwells randomly over a 700 km2area in the Red River Delta,\nand the concentrations of As in groundwater ranged from\n1 to 3050 µg L−1, with an average of 159 µg L−1.Separately,\nWinkel et al.(2011) collected 512 water samples from pri-\nvate wells in the Red River ﬂoodplain and found As concen-\ntrations varying from <0.1 to 810 µg L−1, with 27 % of the\nsamples exceeding the WHO guideline value of 10 µg L−1.Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1481\nThe high concentrations of As reduce the quality of rice har-\nvested in the RRD if As gets into soils and river waters indi-\nrectly through the usage of As-enriched groundwater (Fig.4).In a study on As accumulation in white rice from the Red\nRiver region in Vietnam, Phuong et al.(1999) reported As\nvalues of between 0.03 and 0.47 µg g−1d wt with the mean\nvalue at 0.21 µg g−1d wt.The mean value was higher than the\nmean value reported for Thai rice (0.14 µg g−1d wt; range:\n0.01 to 0.39 µg g−1) (Meharg et al., 2009).Lastly, although high As concentrations in groundwater\nare common in the RRD (cf.Berg et al., 2007; Luu, 2019;\nH. V .Pham et al., 2018; Winkel et al., 2011), there is no re-\nsearch on (groundwater induced) land subsidence in the Red\nRiver Delta.Thus, the magnitude of land subsidence in the\ndelta is uncertain and should be an area for future research.3.2 Regional anthropogenic drivers\n3.2.1 Upstream dams\nThe Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau and\nﬂows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo-\ndia and southern Vietnam.To meet growing demands for\nelectricity, many small- and large-scale hydropower projects\nhave been commissioned in each country to take advantage\nof this supposedly green and clean source of energy (Nhan\nand Cao, 2019; Manh et al., 2015).A total of 241 dams\nhave been completed in the entire Mekong basin, with an-\nother 29 under construction.A further 91 are currently be-\ning planned.These 361 dams consist of 176 hydropower\ndams and 185 irrigation dams.Of the 364 dams in the\nMekong, 20 are in Vietnamese territory (WLE Mekong\nCGIAR, 2020a).Conversely, the Red River originates in\nYunnan Province in China and ﬂows towards northern Viet-\nnam.It is less heavily dammed, with a total of 105 dams in\nChina and Vietnam.There are 25 hydropower dams, 3 multi-\npurpose dams and 9 irrigation dams in the Red River basin in\nVietnam (Vinh et al., 2014; WLE Mekong CGIAR, 2020b).While there are no dams in the Mekong River Delta or the\nRed River Delta due to their relatively ﬂat elevation, up-\nstream dam development inﬂuences downstream regions in\nmany ways, with the environmental impacts extending far\nbeyond the dam itself (Kondolf et al., 2014).Firstly, a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel and\nsuspended sediment is impounded in reservoirs behind the\ndams instead of being transported downstream.This dimin-\nished sediment load may aggravate erosion downstream from\nthe dam (Nhan and Cao, 2019; Fig.4).Using a network\nmodel, under a “deﬁnitive future” scenario of 38 new dams,\nthe cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River\nDelta would be 51 %.Conversely, under full build-up of\n133 new dams, only 4 % of the pre-dam sediment load will\nreach the delta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Manh et al.(2015)\nalso reached similar conclusions with a quasi-2D hydrody-\nnamic model of suspended sediment dynamics.Floodplainsedimentation would decrease by about 21 % to 96 %, while\nsediment load supplied to the sea at the river will diminish by\n1 % to 95 %, with the extreme values representing full dam\nbuild-up.Even if dam construction was limited to the river\ntributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment\ntrapped could be as high as 68 %, meaning that only about\n32 % of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River\nDelta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Indeed, Binh et al.(2020) found that the suspended sed-\niment loads in the MRD had decreased by 74.1 % in 2012–\n2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang\ncascade in China.']
What are the potential impacts of sea level rise on the coastal zone of Vietnam, particularly in the context of the Mekong Delta region?	The potential impacts of sea level rise on the coastal zone of Vietnam, particularly in the Mekong Delta region, include increased flood risks and salinity intrusion. These changes can have significant effects on infrastructure and agricultural practices, such as rice production. Additionally, the frequency of floods in the Mekong Delta may decrease due to river-bed mining and dyke construction. However, these adaptations can also lead to other environmental and social challenges.	['Hens, L., Thinh, N. A., Hanh, T. H., Cuong, N. S., Lan, T. D.,\nThanh, N. V ., and Le, D.

Based on the provided context, what are the potential impacts of infrastructure on flood occurrences in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	The construction of dams upstream can significantly impact flood occurrences in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam. These dams trap a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel, and suspended sediment in reservoirs, which would otherwise be transported downstream. This reduction in sediment load can exacerbate erosion downstream from the dam. Under certain scenarios, the cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River Delta could be as high as 51% or even 96%, which could significantly alter the hydrodynamics of the region and potentially increase flood risks.

W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1481\nThe high concentrations of As reduce the quality of rice har-\nvested in the RRD if As gets into soils and river waters indi-\nrectly through the usage of As-enriched groundwater (Fig.4).In a study on As accumulation in white rice from the Red\nRiver region in Vietnam, Phuong et al.(1999) reported As\nvalues of between 0.03 and 0.47 µg g−1d wt with the mean\nvalue at 0.21 µg g−1d wt.The mean value was higher than the\nmean value reported for Thai rice (0.14 µg g−1d wt; range:\n0.01 to 0.39 µg g−1) (Meharg et al., 2009).Lastly, although high As concentrations in groundwater\nare common in the RRD (cf.Berg et al., 2007; Luu, 2019;\nH. V .Pham et al., 2018; Winkel et al., 2011), there is no re-\nsearch on (groundwater induced) land subsidence in the Red\nRiver Delta.Thus, the magnitude of land subsidence in the\ndelta is uncertain and should be an area for future research.3.2 Regional anthropogenic drivers\n3.2.1 Upstream dams\nThe Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau and\nﬂows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo-\ndia and southern Vietnam.To meet growing demands for\nelectricity, many small- and large-scale hydropower projects\nhave been commissioned in each country to take advantage\nof this supposedly green and clean source of energy (Nhan\nand Cao, 2019; Manh et al., 2015).A total of 241 dams\nhave been completed in the entire Mekong basin, with an-\nother 29 under construction.A further 91 are currently be-\ning planned.These 361 dams consist of 176 hydropower\ndams and 185 irrigation dams.Of the 364 dams in the\nMekong, 20 are in Vietnamese territory (WLE Mekong\nCGIAR, 2020a).Conversely, the Red River originates in\nYunnan Province in China and ﬂows towards northern Viet-\nnam.It is less heavily dammed, with a total of 105 dams in\nChina and Vietnam.There are 25 hydropower dams, 3 multi-\npurpose dams and 9 irrigation dams in the Red River basin in\nVietnam (Vinh et al., 2014; WLE Mekong CGIAR, 2020b).While there are no dams in the Mekong River Delta or the\nRed River Delta due to their relatively ﬂat elevation, up-\nstream dam development inﬂuences downstream regions in\nmany ways, with the environmental impacts extending far\nbeyond the dam itself (Kondolf et al., 2014).Firstly, a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel and\nsuspended sediment is impounded in reservoirs behind the\ndams instead of being transported downstream.This dimin-\nished sediment load may aggravate erosion downstream from\nthe dam (Nhan and Cao, 2019; Fig.4).Using a network\nmodel, under a “deﬁnitive future” scenario of 38 new dams,\nthe cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River\nDelta would be 51 %.Conversely, under full build-up of\n133 new dams, only 4 % of the pre-dam sediment load will\nreach the delta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Manh et al.(2015)\nalso reached similar conclusions with a quasi-2D hydrody-\nnamic model of suspended sediment dynamics.Floodplainsedimentation would decrease by about 21 % to 96 %, while\nsediment load supplied to the sea at the river will diminish by\n1 % to 95 %, with the extreme values representing full dam\nbuild-up.Even if dam construction was limited to the river\ntributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment\ntrapped could be as high as 68 %, meaning that only about\n32 % of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River\nDelta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Indeed, Binh et al.(2020) found that the suspended sed-\niment loads in the MRD had decreased by 74.1 % in 2012–\n2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang\ncascade in China.']

What are the regional consequences of seawater intrusion on rice productivity and land use in the coastal area of the Mekong River Delta, according to the report by Kotera, Sakamoto, Nguyen, and Yokozawa?	The context does not provide specific details on the regional consequences of seawater intrusion on rice productivity and land use in the coastal area of the Mekong River Delta according to the report by Kotera, Sakamoto, Nguyen, and Yokozawa.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '1490 K.

"""What are the drivers of change and potential adaptation pathways for agricultural systems in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam, particularly in relation to increased salinity intrusion due to climate change?"""	The drivers of change in the agricultural systems in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam include climate change, land-use change, and human activities such as river-bed mining and dyke construction. These changes have led to increased salinity intrusion, particularly due to climate change, which impacts rice production. Potential adaptation pathways for these agricultural systems could involve sustainable adaptation strategies, such as system dynamics modelling for vulnerable mega-deltas. This could help in evaluating the sustainability of rice agriculture in these regions. Additionally, addressing issues like illegal sand mining and managing the conversion of agricultural land in peri-urban areas could also be part of the adaptation strategies.

What are the impacts of salinity intrusion on rice production in the Red River Delta under changing climate conditions, as discussed in the context?	Salinity intrusion, exacerbated by rising sea levels and accelerated coastal subsidence due to excessive groundwater extraction, can have significant impacts on rice production in the Red River Delta. This intrusion facilitates the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients. This issue is particularly severe during the dry season. Increased soil salinization leads to a loss of land available for rice production. Furthermore, the existing sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices may prove inadequate if not properly maintained and upgraded. Climate change could also intensify these problems by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as typhoons and sea level rise, which may induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.	['(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.']

"""What are the potential impacts of dam construction on the geomorphology of the Mekong Delta, and how might this contribute to land loss in the region?"""	The construction of dams can significantly impact the geomorphology of the Mekong Delta. Dams, such as the Manwan and Dachaoshan dams, have contributed to a reduction in sediment loads. This reduction can have a direct impact on the size of the delta and the areas suitable for rice cultivation. Additionally, sand mining can contribute to the annual riverbed incision, further altering the landscape. Dams also modify stream discharge and water levels, which can have effects on water supplies. During the rainy season, dams can impound excess water, and during the dry season, they can release water downstream. This modification of seasonal water flows can be problematic as it changes natural flow patterns, which can affect rice production as the rice growing calendars are linked to these natural fluctuations. Furthermore, lowered water levels during dry seasons due to upstream water impoundment can lead to increased saltwater intrusion, creating unfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers. These changes can contribute to land loss in the region as they create unfavorable conditions for crop growth and can potentially lead to a decrease in the size of the delta.	['In particular, the Manwan and Dachaoshan\ndams contributed to 32 % of the reduction.In addition,\nfrom 2014–2017, the average incision rate of the Tien River\nin the MRD was 3 times higher than the previously recorded\nvalue.Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of\n14.8 % of the annual riverbed incision, while the remainder\nwas caused by hydropower dams upstream.The deleterious impacts of dams on sediment loads can\nalso be found in the Red River Delta in spite of the smaller\nnumber of dams.While the Hoa Binh dam is located on a\ntributary of the Red River in Vietnam, its large size has in-\nﬂuenced suspended sediment distribution in the lower Red\nRiver basin.For example, an analysis of the suspended sedi-\nment concentration over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010\nshowed that yearly suspended sediment ﬂux had dropped by\n61 % at Son Tay near Hanoi (Vinh et al., 2014).Similarly,\nDuc et al.(2012) calculated that the suspended sediment bud-\nget at Son Tay and Hanoi hydrological monitoring stations\nwas reduced by 56 % after the Hoa Binh dam became oper-\national in 1989.The reduction in sediment loads at the Red\nRiver Delta would likewise have a similar impact on delta\nsize and rice growing areas.Besides a change in sediment loads, dams also alter stream\ndischarge and water levels, with concurrent effects on wa-\nter supplies (not shown in Fig.4).When water levels are\nhigh during the rainy season, dams can be used to impound\nthe excess water in the reservoir behind.During the dry sea-\nson, when water levels are lower, the dams can release wa-\nter downstream.In doing so, dams increase dry-season dis-\ncharge and decrease wet-season discharge.The modiﬁcation\nof seasonal water ﬂows is problematic as changes in natu-\nral ﬂow patterns, such as higher ﬂows in the dry season and\nlower ﬂows in the wet season, would affect rice production\nas rice growing calendars are currently linked to the natu-\nral ﬂuctuations in high and low ﬂows (Robert, 2017).Hence,\nchanges in water levels due to anthropogenic interventions\nmay create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if plant-\ning calendars remain unchanged.In addition, lowered water\nlevels during dry seasons due to upstream water impound-\nment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion and create\nunfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

"""What are the potential impacts of rising sea levels on the Mekong Delta, as discussed in the provided context?"""	Rising sea levels could have several impacts on the Mekong Delta. They could reduce the recurrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m height to once every 49 years. This could lead to breaches in inadequately constructed and poorly maintained dikes and embankments, resulting in saltwater flooding that damages rice growing areas and other properties. Rising sea levels, along with accelerated coastal subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction, could cause large portions of the low-lying areas to be inundated and flooded. This could facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients. Salinity intrusion could worsen during the dry season, affecting approximately 1.8 million ha in the Mekong Delta, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1. This area is predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea levels. Increased soil salinization could lead to a loss of land available for rice production. Existing sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices may be inadequate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.	['(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'Hens, L., Thinh, N.

Based on the context, how has the transformation of agriculture and rural life downstream of Hanoi impacted rice farming in the Mekong Delta?	The transformation of agriculture and rural life downstream of Hanoi has significantly impacted rice farming in the Mekong Delta. Rapid urbanization has led to the loss of agricultural land, with a significant amount of this land-use conversion occurring in peri-urban areas. This has resulted in a decline in rice growing areas. Additionally, high land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land have forced farmers to practice agricultural intensification. Furthermore, the shift towards non-rice crops and aquaculture has also affected rice farming. Higher prices and rising demand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incentivized farmers to move away from rice monoculture. Environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops. Government policies encouraging farmers to move away from growing rice have also contributed to the planting of more non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is increased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards, and freshwater and brackish aquaculture. Despite these changes, many farmers continue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops.	['1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.', '1478 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 4. Flow diagram showing the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. The drivers\nare classiﬁed as a local driver if it occurs in the two mega-deltas. Regional drivers are those that occur farther away from the two mega-deltas\nbut within the Asian region. A plus ( +) sign indicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to increase (decrease). A negative ( −) sign\nindicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to decrease (increase). Dashed lines with “ ±” are used when outcomes are unclear. For\nexample, dikes reduce ﬂooding, but poorly maintained or planned dikes increase ﬂooding instead. In addition, dikes may potentially cause\nﬂooding in unprotected areas. Agrochemical use may reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but the overuse of chemicals can lead to\npesticide resistance, which may increase outbreaks of pests and diseases.\nFinally, government policies encouraging farmers to move\naway from growing rice also contributed to the planting of\nmore non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is\nincreased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards,\nand freshwater and brackish aquaculture (Van Kien et al.,\n2020). Using remote sensing to assess land-use and land-\ncover change in the Mekong River Delta, Liu et al. (2020)\nfound that aquaculture had become the second-largest land-\nuse type, following planted land. This was facilitated by gov-\nernment regulations, salt intrusion and higher proﬁtability\nof aquaculture productions. In any case, even though farm-\ners may have moved on from growing rice, many still con-\ntinue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops\n(Normile, 2013; Fig. 4).\n3.1.2 Urban expansion\nRapid urbanization is accelerating the loss of agricultural\nland in both the Red River Delta and Mekong River Delta. In\nHanoi, a major city in the Red River Delta, 1420 ha of agri-cultural land was lost per year from 2000–2007, equivalent to\na yearly loss of 3 %. By 2025, up to 450 000 ha of agricultural\nland is expected to be converted to urban land. Most of this\nland-use conversion occurs in peri-urban areas 5–15 km from\nthe city center. The same peri-urban land is often used to\ngrow food, ﬂowers and livestock for the urban population in\nHanoi. However, this land is considered by local authorities\nto be land reserve for urban planning instead of resources for\nfood supply (Drebold, 2017; Pham et al., 2015). Most of this\nperi-urban agricultural land is often forcibly obtained, with\nminimal compensation given to farmers, and then sold to for-\neign developers (Drebold, 2017). Similar urban expansion is\nalso occurring in Can Tho city in the Mekong River Delta,\nwith corresponding losses of agricultural land (cf. Garscha-\ngen et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2010). A decline in agricultural\nland means a decline in rice growing areas as well (Fig. 4).\nHigh land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land\nhave forced farmers to practice agricultural intensiﬁcation. In\nthe RRD, rice production grew more than 25 % from 2000–\n2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

What are the main environmental threats to the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, and how does the intrusion of saline water affect agricultural production and freshwater supply in the region?	The Vietnamese Mekong Delta faces several environmental threats, including the impact of upstream hydropower dams, climate change, and sea level rise. These factors can alter the hydrodynamics of the region, leading to increased salinity intrusion. Salinity intrusion, in turn, can have significant impacts on agricultural production and freshwater supply in the region. For instance, it can affect the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping, a crucial agricultural activity in the region. Additionally, the increased salinity can also pose a risk to the freshwater supply, making it less suitable for consumption or use in agriculture.

"""What are the four causes of the recent increase in saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how does riverbed sand mining contribute to this issue?"""	The four causes of the recent increase in saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta are upstream dam construction, sea level rise, land subsidence, and riverbed mining. Riverbed mining contributes to this issue by causing riverbed incision, which is the lowering of the riverbed due to the removal of sediment. This process can alter the balance between fresh and saline water in the delta. The incision rates from riverbed mining are considered to be the most underestimated and have the highest rates among the four causes. Therefore, controlling sediment excavation volumes from riverbed mining is a key strategy to slow down the incision rate and mitigate the intrusion of saline water in the Mekong Delta.	"[""exclusively associated with the reach of the Mekong with the highest\nriverbed mining risks, i.e.Tan Chau to My Thuan.Accordingly, we spec-\nulated that the IR caused from dams would also vary, ranging from\n15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020b ).For SLR and LS, we refer to the previously published results, respectivelyreporting the IRs of 1.5 –2 cm/year and 0.82 cm/year ( Eslami et al., 2019 ;\nMinderhoud et al., 2017 ).Among the estimated IRs, we consider that\nthe riverbed mining is the most likely to be underestimated.This isdue to the generalization of the IR across the VMD using the values\ndriven from local-scale survey, and the crude characterization of ba-\nthymetry in the VMD, which is based on extrapolation of the single\nbeam echosounder ( Binh et al., 2020b ).Admittedly, advanced bathym-\netry survey methods such as multibeam echosounder (MBES) mighthave resulted in more accurate estimations of riverbend incision rates.However, covering the world's third largest delta using MBES would\nnot be feasible in terms of time and cost.Plus, given the absence of\nother viable alternatives, what we propose here could lay an important\ngroundwork that can inspire following up research for improvements\nfrom the relevant scienti ﬁc community.The resulting IRs, estimation\nmethods, and the key references are summarized in Table 3 .4.2.Policy outlooks - the need for both integrated and adaptive approaches\n4.2.1.Evidence-based priority of countermeasures\nAccording to our initial assessment on IRs presented in Table 3 ,t h e\nupstream dams have the most signi ﬁcant impact, followed by the river-\nbed mining, SLR and LS, constituting an evidence-based priority for\ndealing with the SI intensifying drivers.However, the major discrepan-\ncies in politics, philosophies and economic interests among the coun-\ntries sharing the Mekong River water resources ( Kansal et al., 2019 )\nwould make negotiating over the hydropower dams with the upstreamcountries an uphill battle for the Vietnam government.In contrast, the\nthree domestic issues should be more immediately manageable with\nregulatory and enforcement measures at different administration levels.Accordingly, with a speci ﬁc consideration of the three domestic pres-\nsures contributing to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, riverbed mining has the\nhighest IRs and substantially higher than those of SLR and LS.It is there-\nfore underlined that mitigating the intrusion of saline water in the VMD\nshould ﬁrst work on strategies to slow down the IR contributing from\nriverbed mining by controlling the sediment excavation volumes.Thiscall for bold, nation-wide actions to decisively control the exports of\nthe riverbed sediments while raising the disciplinary actions against il-\nlegal mining to effectively halt the sinking rate of the delta and safe-\nguard the livelihood of millions of inhabitants.4.2.2.Encouraging eco-based livelihoods for better adaptations\nLivelihood adaptation to salinity intrusion is another key aspect for\npolicy reforms.Our study has indicated how the saline water protrudes\nfurther inland and on a more frequent basis.Other studies have already\nshown how SI and other environmental pressures put millions of inhab-\nitants at critical risks ( Park et al., 2020a ;Park et al., 2020b ;Tamura et al.,\n2020 ;Loc et al., 2020a, 2020b ;Pham et al., 2020 ).Active adaptation to\nsalinity intrusion and living with salinity has also been put on the policy\nagenda with the Mekong Delta Plan (2013) , Resolution 120 in 2017.Moreover, agricultural models are increasingly adopted that thrive onsalinity intrusion.Basically, there are two options.Either farmersadapt their cropping to the wet-dry seasonality and grow a brackish\ncrop during the dry season ( Loc et al., 2017, 2018, 2020a, 2020b ;Tan\net al., 2020 ;Pham et al., 2020 ).The rice-shrimp system is well adapted\nto the regular rain-dry season spell, where a decent crop of rice can be\nharvested during the wet season, followed by the raising of an extensivecrop\nof shrimp."", ""Sea level rise\nDam constructioncaused by the riverbed incision.Finally, we introduc e a novel approach using the annual incision rates of the\nriverbed to compare four SI driving factors in terms of t heir relative contributions to the balance between\nfresh and saline water in the VMD.©2 0 2 0E l s e v i e rB .V .A l lr i g h t sr e s e r v e d .1.Introduction\nThe Mekong River originates from the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau, runs\nacross China and ﬁve other countries, and forms the Vietnamese Me-\nkong Delta (VMD) at the downstream course before draining into the\nEast Sea.With a total area of more than 4 million ha, VMD houses 17\nmillion people and accounts for half of the country's food supplies.With the current productivity of ~25 million tons of rice every year,\nVMD not only safeguards the country's food security but also contrib-\nutes about 18.7% of the national GDP through agricultural products ex-\nports ( Dung et al., 2019 ;Eslami et al., 2019 ;GSO, 2016 ;Piesse, 2019 ).The sustainable development of this important food basket, however,is under several internal and external environmental pressures (e.g.Arias et al., 2019 ;Trung and Thanh, 2013 ;Triet et al., 2017 ).Upstream,\nthere is the looming threat from the accelerated construction of hydro-power dams which have drastically modiﬁ ed the hydro-sedimentary\nregimes of the river (e.g.Anthony et al., 2015 ;Dinh et al., 2012 ;\nEslami et al., 2019 ;Van et al., 2012 ;Yang et al., 2019 ).Operation of\nthese dam reservoirs, combined with the downstream sea level rise(SLR) has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's\nshorelines ( Li et al., 2017 ).Internally in VMD, Park et al.(2020a) re-\nported on the constant decrease of ﬂood frequency over the past two\ndecades due to sand mining and dike construction in both the wet and\ndry seasons (1995 –2015).Several authors, including Brunier et al.(2014) ;Hackney et al.(2020) ;a n d Binh et al.(2020b) have also re-\nported signi ﬁcant geomorphic impacts due to extensive mining in the\nlower reach of the river such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank ero-\nsion.Likewise, due to the groundwater extraction, VMD is currently\nexperiencing land subsidence (LS) at an alarming rate; in the worst-\ncase scenario, this can be as much as a meter by 2050 ( Erban et al.,\n2014 ).Within the long list of environmental perils that VMD is facing, the\nintrusion of saline water is the main threat towards agriculturalproduction as it salinizes the essential freshwater resources, while\nsimultaneously degrading the soil on its penetration path.Annually, ap-\nproximately 2 million ha of agricultural land are prone to the risks of sa-\nlinity intrusion (SI) ( Smajgl et al., 2015 ;Toan, 2014 ).In addition, the\nintrusion of saline water can disrupt the supply of freshwater for bothdomestic (e.g.household daily use) and industrial consumers, especially\nin the coastal areas.Carew-Reid (2008) remarked that during dry sea-\nsons, strong northwestward winds combined with ﬂood tides and sea\nwater, can penetrate anywhere inland between 40 and 60 km from\nthe estuaries on both east and west coasts of the delta.While these\nnumbers seem signi ﬁcant, they pale in comparison to observations\nfrom the 2016 drought, which is the most severe event over the past90 years ( Kantoush et al., 2017 ).The event affected 12 out of 13 prov-\ninces in VMD (>2 million ha in area); of which were forced to declarea\nstate of natural disaster ( Toan, 2017 ).The total economic loss was es-\ntimated to be around 650 million USD, including 800,000 tons of ricecompletely lost.In addition, the lives of 17 million VMD inhabitants\nwere adversely affected.In 2020, the VMD experienced yet another cat-\nastrophic drought which possibly surpasses any historical records, in-\ncluding the ones observed in 2016 (From the local news: https://vtv.vn).""]"

What methods were used to investigate the changes in backwater effects and how these changes control the extent and intensity of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	The investigation into the changes in backwater effects and their control over the extent and intensity of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, was conducted using several methods. The analysis was based on extensive sets of hourly-to-daily hydrological time series from 11 gauge stations across the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Signs of significantly increased tidal amplification were revealed through spectral analysis of the hourly water level data. This trend was further validated through changes in slopes of the rating curves at the tidal zones, which implied the relationships between the shift of the backwater effects on the rivers in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta and the lowered water levels. Additionally, numerical modeling was used to assess the recent intensification of salinity intrusion.

Based on the report, which year experienced the most areas affected by drought and saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?

"[""Sea level rise\nDam constructioncaused by the riverbed incision.Finally, we introduc e a novel approach using the annual incision rates of the\nriverbed to compare four SI driving factors in terms of t heir relative contributions to the balance between\nfresh and saline water in the VMD.©2 0 2 0E l s e v i e rB .V .A l lr i g h t sr e s e r v e d .1.Introduction\nThe Mekong River originates from the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau, runs\nacross China and ﬁve other countries, and forms the Vietnamese Me-\nkong Delta (VMD) at the downstream course before draining into the\nEast Sea.With a total area of more than 4 million ha, VMD houses 17\nmillion people and accounts for half of the country's food supplies.With the current productivity of ~25 million tons of rice every year,\nVMD not only safeguards the country's food security but also contrib-\nutes about 18.7% of the national GDP through agricultural products ex-\nports ( Dung et al., 2019 ;Eslami et al., 2019 ;GSO, 2016 ;Piesse, 2019 ).The sustainable development of this important food basket, however,is under several internal and external environmental pressures (e.g.Arias et al., 2019 ;Trung and Thanh, 2013 ;Triet et al., 2017 ).Upstream,\nthere is the looming threat from the accelerated construction of hydro-power dams which have drastically modiﬁ ed the hydro-sedimentary\nregimes of the river (e.g.Anthony et al., 2015 ;Dinh et al., 2012 ;\nEslami et al., 2019 ;Van et al., 2012 ;Yang et al., 2019 ).Operation of\nthese dam reservoirs, combined with the downstream sea level rise(SLR) has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's\nshorelines ( Li et al., 2017 ).Internally in VMD, Park et al.(2020a) re-\nported on the constant decrease of ﬂood frequency over the past two\ndecades due to sand mining and dike construction in both the wet and\ndry seasons (1995 –2015).Several authors, including Brunier et al.(2014) ;Hackney et al.(2020) ;a n d Binh et al.(2020b) have also re-\nported signi ﬁcant geomorphic impacts due to extensive mining in the\nlower reach of the river such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank ero-\nsion.Likewise, due to the groundwater extraction, VMD is currently\nexperiencing land subsidence (LS) at an alarming rate; in the worst-\ncase scenario, this can be as much as a meter by 2050 ( Erban et al.,\n2014 ).Within the long list of environmental perils that VMD is facing, the\nintrusion of saline water is the main threat towards agriculturalproduction as it salinizes the essential freshwater resources, while\nsimultaneously degrading the soil on its penetration path.Annually, ap-\nproximately 2 million ha of agricultural land are prone to the risks of sa-\nlinity intrusion (SI) ( Smajgl et al., 2015 ;Toan, 2014 ).In addition, the\nintrusion of saline water can disrupt the supply of freshwater for bothdomestic (e.g.household daily use) and industrial consumers, especially\nin the coastal areas.Carew-Reid (2008) remarked that during dry sea-\nsons, strong northwestward winds combined with ﬂood tides and sea\nwater, can penetrate anywhere inland between 40 and 60 km from\nthe estuaries on both east and west coasts of the delta.While these\nnumbers seem signi ﬁcant, they pale in comparison to observations\nfrom the 2016 drought, which is the most severe event over the past90 years ( Kantoush et al., 2017 ).The event affected 12 out of 13 prov-\ninces in VMD (>2 million ha in area); of which were forced to declarea\nstate of natural disaster ( Toan, 2017 ).The total economic loss was es-\ntimated to be around 650 million USD, including 800,000 tons of ricecompletely lost.In addition, the lives of 17 million VMD inhabitants\nwere adversely affected.In 2020, the VMD experienced yet another cat-\nastrophic drought which possibly surpasses any historical records, in-\ncluding the ones observed in 2016 (From the local news: https://vtv.vn)."", 'Vietnam Academy of\nWater Research, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development, Hanoi, Vietnam(in Vietnamese).Torrence, C., Compo, G.P., 1998.A practical guide to wavelet analysis.Bull.Am.Meteorol.Soc.79 (1), 61 –78.Triet, N.V.K., Nguyen, V.D., Fujii, H., Kummu, M., Merz, B., Apel, H., 2017.Has dyke devel-\nop\nment in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta shifted ﬂood hazard downstream?Hydrol.Earth Syst.Sci.21, 3991.Trung, N.H., Thanh, V.Q., 2013.Vulnerability to ﬂood in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta:\nmapping and uncertainty assessment.J.

What is the impact of the increasing discharge from upstream dams and riverbed incision on the dry season water level in the Mekong Delta?	The increasing discharge from upstream dams and riverbed incision are contributing to a decrease in the dry season water level in the Mekong Delta. Despite the discharge from dams increasing by 33% between 2009 and 2015, this has not been sufficient to maintain the water level. This is due to factors such as reservoir sediment trapping and sand mining, which cause continuous incision of the riverbeds. As a result, the dry season water level in the Mekong Delta is expected to continue decreasing.	"[""Mekong River will need to increase by more than 50% by dams' water\nrelease to maintain the water level unchanged. While riverbeds are con-\ntinuously incised due to reservoir sediment trapping and sand mining(Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020a ), that high level of discharge re-\nlease from upstream dams is not always possible. In fact, Binh et al.\n(2020c) found that the mean dry season discharge (i.e. in January –May) at Kratie increased by only 33% in 2009 –2015 (when 64 dams\nwere completed in the Mekong basin) from the pre-dam period(1980 –1992). Consequently, the dry season water level in the VMD is\nexpected to continue decreasing. Fig. 1 B shows signi ﬁcant riverbed inci-\nsion along the entire Tien and Hau River from 1998 to 2008, averaged bytwo to three meters. Binh et al. (2020a) found that the annual river bed\nFig. 1.

What are the factors contributing to the increasing trends of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	The intensification of saline water intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta is caused by three anthropogenic drivers: riverbed incision, which is due to both riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence. Among these, riverbed mining, which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year, is highlighted as a significant factor that can amplify the salinity intrusion.

Based on the report, how has the increase in sand mining activities around My Thuan station affected the tidal signals and water levels in the Tien river?	The increase in sand mining activities around My Thuan station has led to a significant drop in water levels in the Tien river. This, in turn, has resulted in stronger bed level erosion and an intensification of tidal signals. Specifically, the 12-hour frequency tidal amplitude at My Thuan station increased by 66%. This increase is substantially higher than the 20% increase observed at the coastal station, Dai Ngai. The higher rate of sand mining at My Thuan (8 million tons/year) compared to Dai Ngai (1 million ton/year) is believed to be the cause of these changes.	"[""incision volume in 2014 –2017 from Tan Chau to My Thuan in the Tien\nRiver (52.5 Mm3/year) was nearly three times greater than that in\n1998 –2008 in the entire Tien and Hau Rivers (20 Mm3/year). They\nclaimed that the increased riverbed incision was caused by upstream\ndams (85%) and sand mining (15%). The increasing riverbed incision be-\ntween 1998 and 2008 and 2014 –2017 periods were consistent with the\nrapidly decreased water level at Tan Chau and Chau Doc in post-2011\ncompared to pre-2011 ( Fig. 2 A–B). Additionally, increasing riverbank\nerosion ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Jordan et al., 2019 ) may contribute to\nwater level reduction at riverine stations because of the expansion of\nthe cross-sectional area.\nOn the other hand, the mean annual water levels (calculated from\nthe hourly water level data) at three tidal stations along the coastline:\nBen Trai, My Thanh, and Binh Dai all presented signi ﬁcant increasing\ntrends since the 1990s ( p-value < 0.001) ( Fig. 2 D–F). In particular, the\nmean annual water levels at Ben Trai, My Thanh, and Binh Dai had re-\nspectively increased by approximately 0.072, 0,22 and 0.25 m during\nthe 20-year period from 1990 to 2010. This directly shows the amplify-\ning trend of SLR around VMD which is in line with the ﬁnding by Nhan\n(2016) . The increasing trends of SI across VMD are therefore attributed\nto the combined effects of decreased riverine water levels and increased\ntidal effects. In the following subsections, we further investigate how\nﬂuvial and tidal regimes have shifted in recent decades by analyzing\nthe power spectrum of the water level series.3.2.

We\nspeculate that these unusual increases of the spectral peaks couldhave been attributed to the following: the increased tidal amplitude\n(in the continental shelf due to SLR) ( Nhan, 2016 ), drops in water levels\n(related to the riverbed mining and upstream dams) ( Park et al., 2020a ;\nPark et al., 2020b ), and LS ( Erban et al., 2014 ;Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).\nTable 2 further quanti ﬁes the shifts in the power spectral peaks at all\nthree analyzed stations.

Based on the data provided, how has the frequency of saline water intrusion in My Thuan, Hoa Binh, and Dai Ngai changed before and after the year 2000?	In My Thuan, the frequency of saline water intrusion has increased for 12-hour and half-month periods, and for 1-month periods after the year 2000 compared to before 2000. However, it has decreased for 1-day and 1-year periods. In Hoa Binh, the frequency has increased for 12-hour and 1-month periods after 2000, but decreased for 1-day, half-month, and 1-year periods.

Based on the report, how has the intensification of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta been linked to changes in riverbed incision and tidal forces?	The intensification of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta has been linked to changes in riverbed incision and tidal forces through several observations. The incision volume from Tan Chau to My Thuan in the Tien River between 2014 and 2017 was nearly three times greater than that between 1998 and 2008 in the entire Tien and Hau Rivers. This increased riverbed incision, attributed to upstream dams and sand mining, was consistent with the rapidly decreased water level at Tan Chau and Chau Doc post-2011 compared to pre-2011. This, along with increasing riverbank erosion, may contribute to water level reduction at riverine stations due to the expansion of the cross-sectional area.On the other hand, the mean annual water levels at three tidal stations along the coastline: Ben Trai, My Thanh, and Binh Dai, have shown significant increasing trends since the 1990s. This indicates an amplifying trend of sea-level rise around the Mekong Delta. The increasing trends of saline intrusion across the Mekong Delta are therefore attributed to the combined effects of decreased riverine water levels and increased tidal effects.Furthermore, the power spectral analysis of the tidal effects showed that the amplitudes of almost every spectral peak of the monthly tidal cycles had increased significantly after 2000 at all river stations. This unusual increase could be attributed to the increased tidal amplitude, drops in water levels related to riverbed mining and upstream dams, and land subsidence. In conclusion, the intensifying saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta is driven by multiple environmental pressures, including changes in riverbed incision and tidal forces.

Science of the Total Environment 757 (2021) 143919\n5"", 'The primary analysis of the time series data reveals two contrasting\ntrends of the water level between riverine and tidal stations, both of\nwhich are statistically signi ﬁcant.Considering the relatively unchanged\ndischarge at Kratie in the upstream of the VMD, the decreasing trend ofwater level of two riverine systems (Tien and Hau) can be attributed to\nthe incision of the riverbeds and the erosion of riverbanks.These are\nsubstantially in-line with the results from recently published papers,such as Park et al.(2020a) ,Park et al.(2020b) ,Brunier et al.(2014) or\nJordan et al.(2019) .Conversely, the mean annual water levels along\nthe coastline present increasing trends, implying the enhanced SLR ef-\nfects.The ascending trend of the coastal water levels, which entails\nthe enhancement of BWE is further con ﬁrmed by the FFT-based spectral\nanalysis and RC analysis.The signi ﬁcant shifts of the tidal peaks in the\ncoastal areas and the steepening slopes of the dry season RCs both\npoint to the riverbed induced ampli ﬁcation of BWE, especially during\nthe drought years such as 2016.This inference was indirectly veri ﬁed\nbyEslami et al.(2019) with the numerical modeling showing that\n2–3 m riverbed incisions should be responsible for the past increase in\nsalinity of 0.2 –0.5 PSU/year.However, further studies on investigating\nquantitatively and directly the effects of riverbed incision on detailedmechanism of SI increase are needed.Although the intensifying SI driven by multiple environmental pres-\nsures are increasingly being recognized ( Eslami et al., 2019 ;Hackney\net al., 2020 ;Minderhoud et al., 2017 ), the relative contribution of each\npressure remains poorly understood.Recognizing this gap as an impor-\ntant question for both research and decision-making agendas, we pro-\npose a new approach based on sediment budget to decouple the\ncompound effects on SI from four main drivers of major different geo-\ngraphical scales: upstream dams, riverbed mining, sea-level rise and\nland subsidence.Our approach utilizes the average annual river incision\nrate (IR) in VMD to approximate the level of SI, as the riverbed elevation\nconstitutes the key determinant of water level balance between river\nand coastal (thereby determining the level of BWE).Based on published\nvalues of incision and sand mining budgets, we illustrate the concept,\nwhich points to the predominant contribution of the upstream dams\n(15.6 –45.6 cm/year), followed by the riverbed mining (4.4 cm/year),\nSLR (1.5 –2 cm/year) and LS (0.88 cm/year).This indicates that, while\nthe hydropower dams in the upstream is mainly responsible for the\nriver incision in the VMD, it is important that other localized factors of\nincision such as riverbed mining should be appreciated as anothermain cause which can incise the riverbed by up to 15 cm/year and crit-\nically amplify the saline water intrusion.All the presented physical evidences allow us to draw some future\noutlooks to cope with the intensifying SI of the VMD.First, since the SI\ndrivers relate to different geographical scales, an evidence-based prior-\nity list of SI driving factors should be thoroughly studied and adopted.In\nthis paper, the IR, though only at its conceptual form, has shown its\nmerit hence worth further exploring.Thereupon, countermeasures to\ncope with each driver can be effectively planned and implemented.Second, in addition to controlling the SI, we should also explore ways\nto help the farmers adapt to it.One such approach is the adoption of\neco-based livelihoods, such as prawn-rice rotational crops or saline-\nwater-tolerant fruticulture.In doing so, VMD is in dire need for the insti-\ntutional and legal support from both local and central governments to\nsecure a successful and sustainable transformation for livelihoods.Fi-\nnally, and arguably the most challenging is to continue the effort in\nthe trans-boundary water diplomacy in multiple platforms, both within\nand beyond ASEAN community.Speci ﬁcally, the negative impacts of the\nupstream dams on the VMD should be made known to the wider audi-ence to generate support from the international community.']"
What are the potential impacts of sea level rise and reduced discharge of the Mekong River on the increase of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how might the construction of hydraulic structures affect this issue?	Sea level rise and reduced discharge of the Mekong River can significantly increase salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta. If the sea level rises by 25-30 cm in 2050, salinity intrusion length and concentration could increase by 10 km and 0.5-2.5 g/l in places 15 km from the sea. If there is a combined effect of 20 cm sea level rise and 15% discharge reduction of the Mekong River in the mid-2030s, the salinity isoline of 2.5 g/l could intrude further up-river by 10 km in the main rivers and by 20 km in the paddy field. The numbers would be 20 km and 35 km if a sea level rise of 45 cm combines with a 29% discharge reduction of the Mekong River in the mid-2090s. In addition, the construction of hydraulic structures in the estuaries, such as salinity control sluice gates along the main rivers, which are intended to control salinity intrusion, may paradoxically enhance the length of salinity intrusion up-river due to the reduction of buffering zones near the estuaries.

In a different manner, Mai et al.(2018a) exam-\nined what would happen if there was no emergency water release fromdams in the 2015 –2016 drought event.They revealed that salinity con-\ncentration in places 30 km from the sea will increase by 14 –23% if the\ndischarge entering the VMD decreases by 364 m\n3/s from March 27 to\nApril 27, 2016.The value will be 35 –51% if such discharge reduction\ncombines with a 3.36 cm SLR.In this combined scenario, the SI lengthmay increase by 16 –24 km in the mainstream.Another important driver\nof the recently enhanced SI in the VMD is the increasing construction ofhydraulic structures in the estuaries (i.e.salinity control sluice gates\nalong the main rivers).Surprisingly, the purpose of these hydraulic\nstructures is to control SI but Binh et al.(2020c) numerically found\nthat the construction of salinity control sluice gates along Tien andHau Rivers may enhance the length of SI up-river because of reducing\nbuffering zones near the estuaries.4.Management outlooks and policy implications\n4.1.The need to decouple the contributing factors to the SI: a budgetary\napproach\nThe results presented above have clari ﬁed how the dynamics of\nwater level balance between river and coastal can control the level ofSI in the VMD.The tug of war between salt and freshwater is deter-\nmined by a combined effect of riverbed mining, upstream hydropower\ndams, SLR, and LS.These drivers are recognized at different geographical\nscales; likewise, their respective countermeasures.For instance, while\nriverbed mining or LS can be entirely managed domestically, the opera-\ntion of the upstream dams can only be negotiated via transnational dip-\nlomatic measures.It is therefore critical to understand the roles of each\ndriver to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, hence effectively prioritizing the coun-\ntermeasures.In addition, the limited ﬁnancial and technical resources of\na developing country such as Vietnam critically urge the need to rankthe relative importance of the drivers to plan the mitigation strategies\naccordingly.In fact, a synthesized appreciation of the Mekong River\nbasin from the geomorphology and sedimentary perspectives, such as\nin the neighboring Chao Phraya basin (e.g.Park et al., 2020b ) is impor-\ntant, yet essentially lacking.Besides, the current understanding of SI in the VMD has been the-\nmatically fragmented so far, including for instance, tidal ampli ﬁcations\n(Eslami et al., 2019 ), riverbed mining and bank erosion ( Hackney\net al., 2020 ), or LS ( Minderhoud et al., 2017, 2018 ).The imbalance\ncould have been related to each research teams' technical backgrounds\nand expertise but mainly due to the challenge to separate the com-\npound effects on SI from different pressures.""]"
"""What is the method proposed in the report to estimate the level of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how does it relate to riverbed mining and upstream dams?"""	The report proposes a conceptual approach to estimate the relative contributions to saline intrusion from upstream hydropower dams and riverbed mining. It suggests that the incision rates (IRs) caused by these factors can vary significantly. For instance, the IRs from dams can range from 15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year. The report also considers riverbed mining to be the most likely underestimated factor due to the generalization of the IR across the Mekong Delta using values from local-scale surveys and the crude characterization of bathymetry. Advanced bathymetry survey methods could provide more accurate estimations, but they are not feasible due to time and cost constraints. Therefore, the report proposes this approach as a groundwork for future research. The report also suggests that mitigating saline intrusion should first focus on strategies to slow down the IR from riverbed mining by controlling sediment excavation volumes.	"[""exclusively associated with the reach of the Mekong with the highest\nriverbed mining risks, i.e.Tan Chau to My Thuan.Accordingly, we spec-\nulated that the IR caused from dams would also vary, ranging from\n15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020b ).For SLR and LS, we refer to the previously published results, respectivelyreporting the IRs of 1.5 –2 cm/year and 0.82 cm/year ( Eslami et al., 2019 ;\nMinderhoud et al., 2017 ).Among the estimated IRs, we consider that\nthe riverbed mining is the most likely to be underestimated.This isdue to the generalization of the IR across the VMD using the values\ndriven from local-scale survey, and the crude characterization of ba-\nthymetry in the VMD, which is based on extrapolation of the single\nbeam echosounder ( Binh et al., 2020b ).Admittedly, advanced bathym-\netry survey methods such as multibeam echosounder (MBES) mighthave resulted in more accurate estimations of riverbend incision rates.However, covering the world's third largest delta using MBES would\nnot be feasible in terms of time and cost.Plus, given the absence of\nother viable alternatives, what we propose here could lay an important\ngroundwork that can inspire following up research for improvements\nfrom the relevant scienti ﬁc community.The resulting IRs, estimation\nmethods, and the key references are summarized in Table 3 .4.2.Policy outlooks - the need for both integrated and adaptive approaches\n4.2.1.Evidence-based priority of countermeasures\nAccording to our initial assessment on IRs presented in Table 3 ,t h e\nupstream dams have the most signi ﬁcant impact, followed by the river-\nbed mining, SLR and LS, constituting an evidence-based priority for\ndealing with the SI intensifying drivers.However, the major discrepan-\ncies in politics, philosophies and economic interests among the coun-\ntries sharing the Mekong River water resources ( Kansal et al., 2019 )\nwould make negotiating over the hydropower dams with the upstreamcountries an uphill battle for the Vietnam government.In contrast, the\nthree domestic issues should be more immediately manageable with\nregulatory and enforcement measures at different administration levels.Accordingly, with a speci ﬁc consideration of the three domestic pres-\nsures contributing to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, riverbed mining has the\nhighest IRs and substantially higher than those of SLR and LS.It is there-\nfore underlined that mitigating the intrusion of saline water in the VMD\nshould ﬁrst work on strategies to slow down the IR contributing from\nriverbed mining by controlling the sediment excavation volumes.Thiscall for bold, nation-wide actions to decisively control the exports of\nthe riverbed sediments while raising the disciplinary actions against il-\nlegal mining to effectively halt the sinking rate of the delta and safe-\nguard the livelihood of millions of inhabitants.4.2.2.Encouraging eco-based livelihoods for better adaptations\nLivelihood adaptation to salinity intrusion is another key aspect for\npolicy reforms.Our study has indicated how the saline water protrudes\nfurther inland and on a more frequent basis.Other studies have already\nshown how SI and other environmental pressures put millions of inhab-\nitants at critical risks ( Park et al., 2020a ;Park et al., 2020b ;Tamura et al.,\n2020 ;Loc et al., 2020a, 2020b ;Pham et al., 2020 ).Active adaptation to\nsalinity intrusion and living with salinity has also been put on the policy\nagenda with the Mekong Delta Plan (2013) , Resolution 120 in 2017.Moreover, agricultural models are increasingly adopted that thrive onsalinity intrusion.Basically, there are two options.Either farmersadapt their cropping to the wet-dry seasonality and grow a brackish\ncrop during the dry season ( Loc et al., 2017, 2018, 2020a, 2020b ;Tan\net al., 2020 ;Pham et al., 2020 ).The rice-shrimp system is well adapted\nto the regular rain-dry season spell, where a decent crop of rice can be\nharvested during the wet season, followed by the raising of an extensivecrop\nof shrimp."", 'Therefore, this scope of this paper expands into intro-\nducing a conceptual approach to estimate the relative contributions\nto SI from upstream hydropower dams and riverbed mining.Finally,\nbased on the novel biophysical evidence presented, we recommend\npotential measures for the VMD policy makers to deal with the\never-intensifying intrusion of saline water, incorporating both tech-n i c a la n dp o l i t i c a la s p e c t s .H.H.Loc, D.

What are the main drivers intensifying saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta and what strategies are suggested to mitigate this issue?	The main drivers intensifying saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta are riverbed incision, which is due to both riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence. The study suggests that it is crucial not to underestimate the impacts from these localized factors, especially riverbed-mining, which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the salinity intrusion. To mitigate this issue, the study recommends political reform based on these new findings.

What are some alternative crops or farming methods that can be adopted in areas of the Mekong Delta that are exposed to year-round saline water intrusion?	Farmers in areas of the Mekong Delta exposed to year-round saline water intrusion could consider growing short-season vegetable crops that can be cultivated with the limited fresh water available, such as beans, spinach, and onions. They could also explore salt-tolerant fruticulture, like coconut and pineapple, or brackish aquaculture supported with water infrastructure. Another promising approach is the mangrove-shrimp ecosystem-based model, which involves community involvement in cultivating economically valued species like the black tiger giant shrimp in mangrove forests. This model also encourages farmers to protect the mangrove forests, which in turn provides protection from storm surges.	['Instead of shrimp, farmers could grow a short-season\nvegetable crop that can be grown with the limited fresh water available,\nsuch as beans, spinach, and onions.Another option worth exploring is the salt-tolerant fruticulture (e.g.coconut, pineapple) or brackish aquaculture that is supported with\nwater infrastructure (e.g.separate intake-outtake channels, daily\nrefreshing, use of bio ﬁlters, no groundwater pumping).This is particu-\nlarly important for those areas with year-round exposure to salinewater.Finally, an ecosystem-based model that has shown various\npromising merits while being adopted to the SI prone coastal areas is\nthe mangrove-shrimp ( Nguyen et al., 2020a ).This ecosystem-based\nmodel was built upon the community involvement whereby thefarmers are supported both in terms of ﬁnance and technical know-\nhows to cultivate economically valued (the black tiger giant shrimp)in the mangrove forests.Thereupon, the farmers proactively protect\nthe mangrove forests as their own properties, which in turn, safeguards\nanother important ecosystem service being the protection from storm\nsurges.4.2.3.Transboundary water diplomacy\nEven though the upstream dams pose the most challenging barrier\nto the SI that the VMD currently faces, there are potential pathways to\novercome.The key focus is how to effectively negotiate the co-shared\nwater resources with the competing upstream users, those whose ben-\neﬁts are directly/indirectly related to the hydropower dams.Theoreti-\ncally, this can be done via multinational diplomatic platforms namely,\nthe Mekong River Commission (MRC), the Greater Mekong Subregion\n(GMS) Program, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).However, they have not been as productive as intended due to multiple\ndiscrepancies between the member countries in terms of political/eco-\nnomic interests ( Kansal et al., 2019 ).Plus, not all geographically related\ncountries are keen on multilateral dialogues, instead, they opt for bilat-eral diplomacies, making the unanimity in sharing the resources within\nthe Mekong River Basin even harder to achieve ( Kuenzer and Renaud,\n2012 ).Nevertheless, it is strongly emphasized that the issues of the up-\nstream dams should be constantly discussed at regional and interna-\ntional forums so that the negative impacts of these structures on the\nbasin environment, including the intensi ﬁed salinity can be widely ac-\nknowledged.In doing so, the VMD stakeholders can generate supportfrom the international community, essential for the transboundary\nwater diplomacy plan.5.Conclusions\nThis paper advances the current understanding of SI in the VMD,\nhighlighting the signi ﬁcant recent shifts of the BWE imposed on the riv-\ners.This BWE is driven by four main environmental pressures: riverbed\nincision due to riverbed mining and dam construction, SLR and LS.Our\nanalysis is based on the extensive data sets of hydrological time series\nfrom 11 gauge stations across the VMD, along with ﬁeld survey bathym-\netry data.Table 3\nRiverbed incision rates (IRs) from different drivers.Rank Drivers Rate (cm/year) Estimation method References\n1 Upstream dams 15.6 –45.6 IRtotal−IRriverbed mining Brunier et al.(2014)Binh et al.(2020b)\n2 Riverbed mining 4.4 –15 V\nmined / Area water surface Jordan et al.(2019)Erban et al.(2014)\n3 Sea level rise 1.5 –2 Literature Eslami et al.(2019)\n4 Land subsidence 0–0.82 Literature Minderhoud et al.(2017)H.H.Loc, D.

"""What are the main drivers of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how do they contribute to the increasing salinity levels?"""	The main drivers of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta include reductions in the discharge of the Mekong River, climate change-induced sea level rise (SLR), and the construction of hydraulic structures in the estuaries, such as salinity control sluice gates along the main rivers. Reductions in the river's discharge and sea level rise are major causes of increased salinity intrusion. For instance, if the sea level rises by 25-30 cm in 2050, salinity intrusion length and salinity concentration will increase by 10 km and 0.5 –2.5 g/l in places 15 km from the sea. If there is a combined effect of 20 cm SLR and 15% discharge reduction of the Mekong River in the mid-2030s, the salinity isoline of 2.5 g/l is likely to intrude further up-river by 10 km in the main rivers and by 20 km in the paddy field. The construction of hydraulic structures, intended to control salinity intrusion, can paradoxically enhance the length of salinity intrusion up-river due to the reduction of buffering zones near the estuaries. Other factors contributing to the intensification of salinity intrusion include riverbed mining, land subsidence, and the operation of upstream dams. These drivers operate at different geographical scales and require different countermeasures, from domestic management to transnational diplomatic measures.

In a different manner, Mai et al.(2018a) exam-\nined what would happen if there was no emergency water release fromdams in the 2015 –2016 drought event.They revealed that salinity con-\ncentration in places 30 km from the sea will increase by 14 –23% if the\ndischarge entering the VMD decreases by 364 m\n3/s from March 27 to\nApril 27, 2016.The value will be 35 –51% if such discharge reduction\ncombines with a 3.36 cm SLR.In this combined scenario, the SI lengthmay increase by 16 –24 km in the mainstream.Another important driver\nof the recently enhanced SI in the VMD is the increasing construction ofhydraulic structures in the estuaries (i.e.salinity control sluice gates\nalong the main rivers).Surprisingly, the purpose of these hydraulic\nstructures is to control SI but Binh et al.(2020c) numerically found\nthat the construction of salinity control sluice gates along Tien andHau Rivers may enhance the length of SI up-river because of reducing\nbuffering zones near the estuaries.4.Management outlooks and policy implications\n4.1.The need to decouple the contributing factors to the SI: a budgetary\napproach\nThe results presented above have clari ﬁed how the dynamics of\nwater level balance between river and coastal can control the level ofSI in the VMD.The tug of war between salt and freshwater is deter-\nmined by a combined effect of riverbed mining, upstream hydropower\ndams, SLR, and LS.These drivers are recognized at different geographical\nscales; likewise, their respective countermeasures.For instance, while\nriverbed mining or LS can be entirely managed domestically, the opera-\ntion of the upstream dams can only be negotiated via transnational dip-\nlomatic measures.It is therefore critical to understand the roles of each\ndriver to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, hence effectively prioritizing the coun-\ntermeasures.In addition, the limited ﬁnancial and technical resources of\na developing country such as Vietnam critically urge the need to rankthe relative importance of the drivers to plan the mitigation strategies\naccordingly.In fact, a synthesized appreciation of the Mekong River\nbasin from the geomorphology and sedimentary perspectives, such as\nin the neighboring Chao Phraya basin (e.g.Park et al., 2020b ) is impor-\ntant, yet essentially lacking.Besides, the current understanding of SI in the VMD has been the-\nmatically fragmented so far, including for instance, tidal ampli ﬁcations\n(Eslami et al., 2019 ), riverbed mining and bank erosion ( Hackney\net al., 2020 ), or LS ( Minderhoud et al., 2017, 2018 ).The imbalance\ncould have been related to each research teams' technical backgrounds\nand expertise but mainly due to the challenge to separate the com-\npound effects on SI from different pressures.""]"

"""What are the potential impacts of upstream hydropower dams and climate change on the hydrodynamics of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and its effects on irrigation water availability for rice cropping?"""	Upstream hydropower dams and climate change can significantly impact the hydrodynamics of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. These factors can lead to an increase in salinity intrusion, which is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers. This can have a direct impact on the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping. As the salinity of the water increases, it becomes less suitable for irrigation purposes, potentially affecting the productivity of rice crops in the region. Additionally, the operation of dams and sea level rise can further exacerbate saltwater intrusion into the Mekong Delta.

What are the potential impacts of rising sea levels and salinity intrusion on farming systems in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, according to the provided context?	Rising sea levels and salinity intrusion pose significant threats to farming systems in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Salinity intrusion can salinize essential freshwater resources and degrade the soil, which can severely impact agricultural production. Approximately 2 million hectares of agricultural land are at risk of salinity intrusion annually. This intrusion can also disrupt the supply of freshwater for both domestic and industrial use, especially in coastal areas. During severe events, such as the 2016 drought, the impact can be even more devastating, affecting millions of inhabitants, causing significant economic loss, and leading to a substantial decrease in rice production.

What are the potential impacts of climate change on the seawater intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Climate change, along with upstream hydropower dams, can significantly impact the hydrodynamics of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. This can lead to increased salinity intrusion, which can affect the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping. Additionally, sea level rise and changes in river flow can further intensify this salinity intrusion. The construction of cascade hydropower can also exacerbate the salinity intrusion into the Mekong Delta.

What are the causes and potential impacts of the increasing salinity in the groundwater resources of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, as discussed in the report?	The increasing salinity in the groundwater resources of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam is primarily caused by heavy overexploitation of groundwater, which leads to a decrease in hydraulic heads and increases the potential for seawater intrusion. This overexploitation also results in local land subsidence due to decreased pore pressure from pumping, causing irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. Other contributing factors include natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, a decline in fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change. The potential impacts of this increasing salinity are substantial. It can degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and affect human health. The land subsidence can lead to a loss of land and freshwater, potentially resulting in the inundation of large parts of the delta. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise. Furthermore, the area is threatened by weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons leading to severe droughts, which can increase the demand for fresh groundwater.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What are the potential impacts of groundwater overexploitation, including the risk of seawater intrusion, on the quality of groundwater and human health in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Overexploitation of groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, can lead to several negative environmental impacts. One of the most prominent is the decrease of hydraulic heads, which increases the potential for seawater intrusion. This intrusion can substantially degrade the quality of groundwater, limiting its use for various purposes. Moreover, the degraded water quality can also negatively impact human health. Another significant impact is severe local land subsidence, which is caused by decreased pore pressure due to excessive pumping. This results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. In combination with other processes, such as natural compaction of sediment layers, decline of fluvial sediment supply, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to climate change, the low-lying Mekong Delta is threatened in its very existence. This can lead to a progressive loss of land and freshwater, potentially resulting in the inundation of large parts of the delta.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What are the potential impacts of direct seawater intrusion on the groundwater system in the Ca Mau Peninsula, the southernmost province in Vietnam, and how might it affect the salinization rates in the region?	Direct seawater intrusion into the groundwater system in the Ca Mau Peninsula could substantially degrade the quality of groundwater, limit its use, and affect human health. This is due to the increase in salinity levels in the water. The most prominent negative environmental impact associated with groundwater overexploitation, which can lead to seawater intrusion, is the decrease of hydraulic heads. This could potentially increase the salinization rates in the region. Furthermore, the overexploitation of groundwater can lead to severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with other processes, threatens the very existence of the low-lying areas.

What is the significance of the average thickness of the Miocene aquifer n13 in understanding the geochemistry and evolution of groundwater resources?	The average thickness of the Miocene aquifer n13 is significant in understanding the geochemistry and evolution of groundwater resources as it provides valuable information about the aquifer's capacity and the potential volume of water it can hold. This thickness is calculated by interpolating down to the aquifer from the data gathered from boreholes. This information is crucial in creating a subsurface model, which is used for groundwater mapping. The model helps in understanding the distribution and movement of groundwater, which in turn influences the geochemical characteristics of the water. Furthermore, the model can reveal the relationship between different layers and their impact on water quality and availability. However, it's important to note that the model does not consider small-scale characteristics and discontinuous clay lenses within aquifers, which could also influence the groundwater's geochemistry.	['Average thickness \ncalculated by interpolating down to the Miocene aquifer n13 (chapter 2.2.4).Each aquifer is overlain by the corresponding aquitard (not included \nhere).Ages after Cohen et al.(2013) .The lower boundary from n13 is estimated after Wagner et al.(2012) .J. Bauer et al.', 'Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n7then stacked (Turner, 2006 ).This approach is common in sedimentary environments and is widely used for groundwater mapping \n(Natali et al., 2012 ).Subsurface modelling was conducted using MATLAB 2020b (MathWorks Inc.).Top and bottom boundaries from \n14 layers recorded in 27 boreholes were used as 3-D scattered input data.While almost all boreholes reach aquifer qp1, except one, the number of boreholes reaching deeper layers are gradually decreasing \nwith only seven reaching aquifer n21 and only one the aquitard beneath.As this is a typical phenomenon in lithological data acquisition \n(Turner, 2006 ), all boreholes were vertically interpolated down to the Miocene aquifer n13 based on mean layer thickness from the \navailable data.No information from outside the study area was used because depth and thickness of stratigraphic units significantly \nvary throughout the delta (Nguyen et al., 2000 ) and might have therefore distorted the calculation.For the model, a 2-D grid was \ncreated with a 100m resolution in latitude and longitude direction using the meshgrid command, and for each layer a 3-D data \ninterpolation was done using triangulation-based natural neighbor method with griddata , which was then visualized using the mesh \ncommand.It should be noted that the quality of the provided borehole logs could not be further evaluated here and thus no extensive \nmodel validation was conducted.Based on the straightforward model approach, the model does not consider discontinues clay lenses \nwithin aquifers (Erban et al., 2013 ) and other potential small-scale characteristics, such as paleo channels as well as areas of \nnon-deposition and areas of erosion (Turner, 2006 ).Groundwater samples were plotted in this subsurface model to enable a sample to aquifer assignment.In order to account for a thin \naquitard between aquifer qp2–3 and qp1 and to account for possible aforementioned uncertainties in the interpolation, it was only \ndistinguished between Pleistocene and Pliocene samples.Samples outside of the convex hull were correlated with the nearest borehole \nand assigned to the respective aquifer.In addition, a 71.5 km long geological cross section was drawn through the model area.Samples, larger cities and monitoring wells within a 10km perpendicular distance to the profile were included.Location of monitoring \nwells and the course of the cross section are displayed in Fig.2.Most monitoring wells accumulate around CMC.Extrapolation outside \nthe convex hull of the available borehole data was avoided intentionally to assure a more valid model within the verifiable boundaries.Therefore, the cross-section was not extrapolated to the sea.3.Results \n3.1.Water geochemistry \nMajor geochemical water parameters are listed in Table 2.EC values range between 571 µS/cm and 5180 µS/cm.21 samples have \nEC between 2500 and 3850 µS/cm while two samples in the northwest have EC around 5000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).A mean conversion factor \nfor EC to TDS of 0.81 was calculated.Note that this factor deviates from 0.67, which is commonly used by NAWAPI.As this conversion \nfactor is highly depended on ionic water composition the conversion factor presented here is more accurate for the study area and \nshould be considered for future water use guidelines.Na+is the dominant cation in the majority of samples in CMP.The Piper Diagram in Fig.4 shows that Na-Cl, Na-HCO 3 and mixed \nwater types occur in Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers.Pliocene samples are depleted in Ca2++Mg2+and contain over 70% Na+, while \nsome Pleistocene samples contain more divalent cations, especially those with high EC and a higher proportion of Cl-.Sulfate only \nplays a minor role in the water composition, is mostly below 10% and never exceeds 25%.The spatial distribution of the detailed water \ntype (see chapter 2.2.2) is presented in Fig.3.In this classification the dominant water type is Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl).Only eleven \nsamples are solely dominated by Cl-.It is striking that these samples of Na-Cl type, shown in red, are randomly distributed in CMP.Two \nsamples in the north of CMP are of Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-(Na)-HCO 3 type, colored in blue.']
"""How has the rising sea levels after the last glacial maximum influenced the distribution of saline and fresh groundwater in the Mekong Delta?"""	The rising sea levels after the last glacial maximum have influenced the distribution of saline and fresh groundwater in the Mekong Delta by increasing the potential for seawater intrusion. This intrusion can substantially degrade groundwater quality and limit its use. Additionally, the overexploitation of groundwater in the Mekong Delta has led to a decrease in hydraulic heads, which further increases the risk of seawater intrusion. This situation is exacerbated by local land subsidence induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, which results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. The combination of these factors threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta.

Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What is the significance of molar ion ratios in distinguishing between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers, and how does this relate to salinization?	Molar ion ratios, such as Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl- and Mg2+/Cl-, are useful tools for distinguishing between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. These ratios can be compared to a conservative mixing line to identify the type of water intrusion. In the process of salinization, which is the increase of salt content in an aquifer, these ratios can change. For instance, the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in a coastal area might be well above the seawater ratio of 0.86, indicating a shift due to salinization. This can also be associated with changes in water type, reflecting different stages and geochemical processes associated with salinization. Therefore, detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of molar ion ratios can help identify signs of salinization, even in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.	['However, especially in redox-sensitive \nmarine and coastal settings, the difference between total alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity may not be neglected due to the \nimpact of other buffering bases such as B(OH) 4-, NH3, Si(OH) 3 O-, or F- (Lukawska-Matuszewska, 2016 ).The conversion factor for EC to TDS is highly depended on ionic water composition and may differ from the instrument value, \nwhich is typically calibrated by KCl solution (Vengosh, 2013 ).Therefore, TDS was calculated for each sample using the software \nGeochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC) with the whole elemental composition as input data.Furthermore, the \ndirect relationship between all parameters was calculated using pairwise Spearman correlation.The calcium carbonate system in coastal groundwater settings is complex, and many processes actually lead to carbonate disso -\nlution with subsequent increase in HCO 3- and Ca2+(Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).In saline aquifers, mixing of calcium carbonate \nsaturated fresh groundwater with seawater, which is typically oversaturated, produces brackish water which is undersaturated with \nregard to calcium carbonate due to the reduction in ionic strength, leading to calcite dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).The saturation indices for calcite (SIcalcite) were calculated using Geochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC).Furthermore, SI of additional evaporites including aragonite, dolomite, gypsum, sylvite and halite were calculated.The proportion of major cations Na++K+, Ca2+and Mg2+and anions HCO 3-, Cl- and SO42- were calculated and displayed in a Piper \nDiagram (Piper, 1944 ).The water type can be derived from the upper diamond shape (Back and Hanshaw, 1965 ).Water type analysis \ncan help to distinguish geochemical processes and to derive the origin of solutes.However, divisions and percentages used for clas-\nsification should be selected as to best fit the characteristics of the investigated water (Freeze and Cherry, 1979 ).Therefore, to achieve \na more detailed water type specification and to get more insights on mixed water types, the typical description was customized in order \nto more accurately display different states of salinization with an emphasis on cation-exchange processes.Proportions of major ions \nwere calculated and if only one cation or anion was above 33.3%, it is written alone, like Na-Cl water type, while if two ions were above \n33.3%, the ion with the higher proportion was written first, followed by the second ion in brackets, for example Na-Cl-(HCO 3).A mixed \nwater type is thus only defined if all three anions or cations have an equal share of around 33.3%, e.g.Na-Ca-Mg-Cl is written as Mix-Cl.2.2.3.Salinization and freshening \nThe evaluation of molar ion ratios is an appropriate tool to distinguish between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal \naquifers (Appelo, 1994; Jones et al., 1999; Russak et al., 2016 ).Therefore, Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl- and Mg2+/Cl- molar ratios were \ncalculated and compared to the conservative mixing line.Generally, salinization of a freshwater aquifer by seawater intrusion proceeds J. Bauer et al.', 'Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n12CMP where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low (Kim et al., 2017; Chapelle and McMahon, 1991 ).Overall, this is an \nimportant finding, demonstrating that the increase of EC values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater \nintrusion, but can also be attributed to the generation of additional HCO 3-.4.2.Salinization and freshening processes \nCoastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion, \nrespectively (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Han et al., 2020 ).Fig.8 reveals that the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the \nstudy area is well above the seawater ratio of 0.86.Only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater.It is remarkable that the water \ntype of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing Cl- concentration from Mix-Cl-(HCO 3) and \nCa-Cl-(HCO 3) over Na-Mg-Cl and finally to Na-Cl, while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) \ntype.This observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and \nfreshening.The customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with \nsalinization.It can be observed that Na-Mg-Cl seem to occur at higher Cl- concentrations compared to Ca-Cl-(HCO 3) (see Fig.8), \nprobably because seawater contains more Mg2+over Ca2+with a Mg2+/Ca2+ratio of 4.5–5.2 (Vengosh, 2013 ).The Mg2+/Cl- ratio is \nshown in Fig.9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest Na+/Cl- ratios and salinization water types, again demonstrating the \ncation-exchange processes.The same pattern can be observed for Ca2+/Cl- (Fig.10) but with a wider spread and deviation from the \nmixing line, as Ca2+concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution, which in turn \ndepend on HCO 3- concentrations.In conclusion, freshwater intrusion is, or was, the predominant process leading to the abundant Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) type \ngroundwater in CMP.The rarely occurring groundwater of Na-Cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, where Cl- is still the dominant anion.Further freshening produces waters of Na-HCO 3 type and Cl- below 25mg/L, as found \nin the northeast of the study area.Due to the general hydrogeological conditions, it can also be assumed that the freshening process has \nprogressed furthest in this region.This assumption is supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- \nbetween 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east (Fig.7).It can be expected that both processes, cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decompo -\nsition, contribute to observed Na-HCO 3 groundwater in CMP.Detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of Na+/ \nCl- molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization, \neven in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.Focusing on total salinity via EC analysis alone, however, is not a suitable method.For \nexample, three samples in the central north (Fig.5c) have EC values below 1000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).However, based on their Na+/Cl- \nratio, which is below the seawater line (Fig.7), and their water type (Fig.3), particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of \nsalinization.4.3.Groundwater evolution and development \nMarine transgression and regression phases in the Quaternary (Fig.']
"""What is the process of salinization and how does it affect the groundwater resources in terms of cation exchange in the Mekong Delta?"""	The process of salinization involves the accumulation of salts in soil or water, which can be driven by natural processes or human activities. In the context of the Mekong Delta, groundwater salinization can be influenced by factors such as sea-level rise, land subsidence, and groundwater extraction. This process can have significant impacts on the quality of groundwater resources, potentially leading to issues such as increased salinity levels. However, the context does not provide specific information on how salinization affects cation exchange in the groundwater resources of the Mekong Delta.

Based on the report, how does the salinity level, indicated by EC levels, change across different regions in the Mekong Delta?	The salinity level, indicated by EC levels, varies across different regions in the Mekong Delta. The study found that locations with elevated EC are randomly distributed across the region and are most often represented by more than one sample at each location from both Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers. This suggests that the locations of elevated EC are not a single well phenomenon but a local spatial pattern. The study also found no significant correlation between geochemical patterns and depth or aquifer, and locations with higher EC are not correlated to the distance to the coast. In the southern part of the study region, elevated levels of EC cannot solely be attributed to Cl- associated with seawater but rather to the presence of high HCO3- concentrations.

What does the spatial distribution map of HCO3-, Cl- and EC indicate about the geochemistry and evolution of groundwater resources in the context of climate change?	The spatial distribution map of HCO3-, Cl- and EC indicates that locations with elevated EC are randomly distributed across the study area and are most often represented by more than one sample at each location from both Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers. This suggests that these locations are not a single well phenomenon but a local spatial pattern. This pattern also applies to other ions and ion ratios. The data suggests that aquifers are to some extent connected, either through natural discontinuities in the stratigraphy or hydrological short circuits caused by well leakage or well failure. The study found no significant correlation between geochemical patterns and depth or aquifer, or the distance to the coast. Elevated levels of EC in the southern part of the study region cannot solely be attributed to Cl- associated with seawater but rather to the presence of high HCO3- concentrations. This indicates that the source of HCO3- is not freshwater intrusion. The high concentrations of HCO3- in the south of the study area cannot be explained by simple mixing and calcite dissolution.

What does the report suggest about the impact of increased salinity on the groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta, and how is it related to the shift of the fresh-saline water boundary further inland?	The report suggests that the overexploitation of groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta has led to a decrease in hydraulic heads, which increases the potential for seawater intrusion. This intrusion can significantly degrade the quality of groundwater, limiting its use and potentially affecting human health. The shift of the fresh-saline water boundary further inland is a consequence of this seawater intrusion, which is exacerbated by groundwater extraction. This situation is further complicated by other factors such as land subsidence, natural compaction of sediment layers, decline of fluvial sediment supply, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to climate change. These factors collectively contribute to a progressive loss of land and freshwater, threatening the very existence of the Mekong Delta.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What is the role of organic matter in increasing the concentration of HCO3- in coastal aquifers and how does it affect the calcium carbonate equilibria?	Organic matter in coastal aquifers can contribute to the increase in HCO3- concentration. This happens when the organic matter is oxidized to dissolved inorganic carbon, a process that can result in HCO3- concentrations surpassing those in fresh groundwater at recharge areas. The reduction of organic matter also impacts the calcium carbonate equilibria. This is due to an increase in PCO2 and changes in pH, which can lead to dissolution. High amounts of organic matter, often found in marine and estuarial origins, are consistently present across all stratigraphic layers in certain areas, which could account for high HCO3- concentrations. Furthermore, the process of sulfate reduction, which directly produces HCO3-, leads to sulfate depletion, a characteristic of freshening aquifers rich in organic matter.	['Another possible source of HCO 3- in coastal aquifers is dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter, which is oxidized to \ndissolved inorganic carbon.It was shown in other studies that the concentration of HCO 3- originating from organic matter oxidation \ncan surpass the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times (Chapelle and McMahon, 1991; Orem and \nGaudette, 1984 ).In addition, organic matter reduction also shifts the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in PCO2 as well as \nchanges in pH, and causes dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999 ).Due to their marine and estuarial origin, \nhigh amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers in CMP (Doan et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2010; \nPechstein et al., 2018 ) and could therefore account for high HCO 3- concentrations.Furthermore, sulfate reduction directly produces \nHCO 3- and leads to sulfate depletion, which is typical for freshening aquifers rich in organic matter and might therefore also apply to \nFig.8.Na+/Cl- plot of groundwater samples including water type markers associated with salinization of freshwater aquifers.J. Bauer et al.', 'However, especially in redox-sensitive \nmarine and coastal settings, the difference between total alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity may not be neglected due to the \nimpact of other buffering bases such as B(OH) 4-, NH3, Si(OH) 3 O-, or F- (Lukawska-Matuszewska, 2016 ).The conversion factor for EC to TDS is highly depended on ionic water composition and may differ from the instrument value, \nwhich is typically calibrated by KCl solution (Vengosh, 2013 ).Therefore, TDS was calculated for each sample using the software \nGeochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC) with the whole elemental composition as input data.Furthermore, the \ndirect relationship between all parameters was calculated using pairwise Spearman correlation.The calcium carbonate system in coastal groundwater settings is complex, and many processes actually lead to carbonate disso -\nlution with subsequent increase in HCO 3- and Ca2+(Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).In saline aquifers, mixing of calcium carbonate \nsaturated fresh groundwater with seawater, which is typically oversaturated, produces brackish water which is undersaturated with \nregard to calcium carbonate due to the reduction in ionic strength, leading to calcite dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).The saturation indices for calcite (SIcalcite) were calculated using Geochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC).Furthermore, SI of additional evaporites including aragonite, dolomite, gypsum, sylvite and halite were calculated.The proportion of major cations Na++K+, Ca2+and Mg2+and anions HCO 3-, Cl- and SO42- were calculated and displayed in a Piper \nDiagram (Piper, 1944 ).The water type can be derived from the upper diamond shape (Back and Hanshaw, 1965 ).Water type analysis \ncan help to distinguish geochemical processes and to derive the origin of solutes.However, divisions and percentages used for clas-\nsification should be selected as to best fit the characteristics of the investigated water (Freeze and Cherry, 1979 ).Therefore, to achieve \na more detailed water type specification and to get more insights on mixed water types, the typical description was customized in order \nto more accurately display different states of salinization with an emphasis on cation-exchange processes.Proportions of major ions \nwere calculated and if only one cation or anion was above 33.3%, it is written alone, like Na-Cl water type, while if two ions were above \n33.3%, the ion with the higher proportion was written first, followed by the second ion in brackets, for example Na-Cl-(HCO 3).A mixed \nwater type is thus only defined if all three anions or cations have an equal share of around 33.3%, e.g.Na-Ca-Mg-Cl is written as Mix-Cl.2.2.3.Salinization and freshening \nThe evaluation of molar ion ratios is an appropriate tool to distinguish between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal \naquifers (Appelo, 1994; Jones et al., 1999; Russak et al., 2016 ).Therefore, Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl- and Mg2+/Cl- molar ratios were \ncalculated and compared to the conservative mixing line.Generally, salinization of a freshwater aquifer by seawater intrusion proceeds J. Bauer et al.']
Based on the report, how does the increase of EC values in coastal areas indicate the generation of additional HCO3- rather than recent seawater intrusion?	The increase of EC values in coastal areas can indicate the generation of additional HCO3- rather than recent seawater intrusion because the EC values can rise due to the production of bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). This is an important finding as it shows that high EC values in coastal regions are not necessarily evidence of recent seawater intrusion. Furthermore, the study found that coastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles, which can lead to seawater or freshwater intrusion. However, the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the study area was well above the seawater ratio of 0.86, indicating that the increase in EC values could be attributed to the generation of additional HCO3-.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n12CMP where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low (Kim et al., 2017; Chapelle and McMahon, 1991 ).Overall, this is an \nimportant finding, demonstrating that the increase of EC values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater \nintrusion, but can also be attributed to the generation of additional HCO 3-.4.2.Salinization and freshening processes \nCoastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion, \nrespectively (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Han et al., 2020 ).Fig.8 reveals that the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the \nstudy area is well above the seawater ratio of 0.86.Only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater.It is remarkable that the water \ntype of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing Cl- concentration from Mix-Cl-(HCO 3) and \nCa-Cl-(HCO 3) over Na-Mg-Cl and finally to Na-Cl, while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) \ntype.This observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and \nfreshening.The customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with \nsalinization.It can be observed that Na-Mg-Cl seem to occur at higher Cl- concentrations compared to Ca-Cl-(HCO 3) (see Fig.8), \nprobably because seawater contains more Mg2+over Ca2+with a Mg2+/Ca2+ratio of 4.5–5.2 (Vengosh, 2013 ).The Mg2+/Cl- ratio is \nshown in Fig.9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest Na+/Cl- ratios and salinization water types, again demonstrating the \ncation-exchange processes.The same pattern can be observed for Ca2+/Cl- (Fig.10) but with a wider spread and deviation from the \nmixing line, as Ca2+concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution, which in turn \ndepend on HCO 3- concentrations.In conclusion, freshwater intrusion is, or was, the predominant process leading to the abundant Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) type \ngroundwater in CMP.The rarely occurring groundwater of Na-Cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, where Cl- is still the dominant anion.Further freshening produces waters of Na-HCO 3 type and Cl- below 25mg/L, as found \nin the northeast of the study area.Due to the general hydrogeological conditions, it can also be assumed that the freshening process has \nprogressed furthest in this region.This assumption is supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- \nbetween 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east (Fig.7).It can be expected that both processes, cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decompo -\nsition, contribute to observed Na-HCO 3 groundwater in CMP.Detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of Na+/ \nCl- molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization, \neven in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.Focusing on total salinity via EC analysis alone, however, is not a suitable method.For \nexample, three samples in the central north (Fig.5c) have EC values below 1000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).However, based on their Na+/Cl- \nratio, which is below the seawater line (Fig.7), and their water type (Fig.3), particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of \nsalinization.4.3.Groundwater evolution and development \nMarine transgression and regression phases in the Quaternary (Fig.', 'Another possible source of HCO 3- in coastal aquifers is dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter, which is oxidized to \ndissolved inorganic carbon.It was shown in other studies that the concentration of HCO 3- originating from organic matter oxidation \ncan surpass the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times (Chapelle and McMahon, 1991; Orem and \nGaudette, 1984 ).In addition, organic matter reduction also shifts the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in PCO2 as well as \nchanges in pH, and causes dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999 ).Due to their marine and estuarial origin, \nhigh amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers in CMP (Doan et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2010; \nPechstein et al., 2018 ) and could therefore account for high HCO 3- concentrations.Furthermore, sulfate reduction directly produces \nHCO 3- and leads to sulfate depletion, which is typical for freshening aquifers rich in organic matter and might therefore also apply to \nFig.8.Na+/Cl- plot of groundwater samples including water type markers associated with salinization of freshwater aquifers.J.

Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014;

Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013;

Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012;

Based on the report, what could be the potential impact of the downward migration of shallow saline water on the groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	"The downward migration of shallow saline water in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, could lead to a decrease in the quality of groundwater resources. This is due to the potential for seawater intrusion, which could substantially degrade the quality of the groundwater, limit its use, and negatively impact human health. Additionally, the overexploitation of groundwater can lead to local land subsidence, which results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with other factors, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta.

Based on the research conducted, what are the potential impacts of decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	The potential impacts of decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam include a decrease in hydraulic heads and the potential for seawater intrusion, which could degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and affect human health. Additionally, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, can result in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with additive processes, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. Other impacts include natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, salinization of surface water, and heavy coastal and riverbank erosion. Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons leading to severe droughts, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise.

"""What are the potential impacts of groundwater extraction and climate change on the vulnerability of coastal aquifers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?"""	The potential impacts of groundwater extraction and climate change on the vulnerability of coastal aquifers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, include the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which could substantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and affect human health. Additionally, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with additive processes such as natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, a decline of fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. Some parts of the Delta are also facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion. Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons leading to severe droughts, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise. Overall, these problems can lead to a progressive loss of land and freshwater, which could eventually result in the inundation of large parts of the delta.

What are the potential impacts of 25 years of groundwater extraction on land subsidence in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	The potential impacts of prolonged groundwater extraction in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, include a decrease in hydraulic heads and the risk of seawater intrusion, which could significantly degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and affect human health. Additionally, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters per year can occur. This subsidence is induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, resulting in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. Combined with other processes, such as natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, a decline of fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change, the low-lying Mekong Delta is threatened in its very existence. Some parts of the Mekong Delta are also facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion. Furthermore, weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonged dry seasons leading to severe droughts, can further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater.

Based on the report, how does climate change impact groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta?	Climate change impacts groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta in several ways. One of the major impacts is the rise in sea levels, which can lead to seawater intrusion into the groundwater, degrading its quality and limiting its use. This can also have negative effects on human health. Additionally, climate change can lead to weather extremes and natural hazards, such as floods and prolonged dry seasons, which can result in severe droughts. These conditions can increase the demand for fresh groundwater. Furthermore, the consequences of groundwater extraction in coastal areas often surpass the impact of sea-level rise due to climate change.

"""What is the role of sedimentation and natural compaction in the Mekong Delta, and how does it relate to saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems due to global change?"""	Sedimentation and natural compaction play a significant role in the Mekong Delta. They contribute to the formation and evolution of the delta over time. However, the context does not provide specific details on how these processes directly relate to saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems due to global change. It is known that saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems in the Mekong Delta is a concern, and it has been linked to global change, but the exact relationship between this and the role of sedimentation and natural compaction is not detailed in the provided context.

"""What are the main causes of soil salinization and how does it affect agricultural production, particularly rice cultivation, in the Mekong Delta?"""	The main causes of soil salinization in the Mekong Delta, specifically in Hau Giang province, are seawater intrusion and salinized groundwater. This accumulation of soluble salts in the soil can negatively impact agricultural production by making productive land areas unsuitable for farming or reducing crop yield. In areas with moderate levels of total soluble salts, suitable irrigation methods, salt-tolerant crop varieties, and the use of lime (CaCO3) can be applied to reduce the adverse effects of salinity on agricultural land, including rice cultivation.

"""What are the potential impacts of saltwater intrusion on agricultural production in coastal areas like the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, as mentioned in the report?"""	Saltwater intrusion can have several negative impacts on agricultural production in coastal areas like the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. These impacts include impaired plant uptake of water and essential nutrients, negative effects on crop growth and development, increased weed competition, lower soil microbial activity, and overall reduction in crop productivity. This process is driven by multiple factors, both natural and anthropogenic, including climate change, sea-level rise, and drought. Droughts, in particular, can lead to severe saltwater intrusion events as lack of rainfall results in scarce river discharge and favors marine water inland flow intrusion.

"""What are the impacts of saltwater intrusion and climate change on coastal agriculture, as discussed in the 2023 study by Tarolli et al.?"""	Saltwater intrusion and climate change pose significant threats to coastal agriculture. Changing climatic conditions, including sea-level rise and drought, are causing progressive land degradation, particularly in river deltas. This degradation negatively impacts the sustainable development of agriculture, society, and economy. Saltwater intrusion, a process resulting from both natural and anthropogenic drivers, is a particular risk for freshwater sources near the sea. Droughts can exacerbate this issue by reducing river discharge and promoting the inland flow of marine water. The impacts on agricultural production are numerous, including impaired plant uptake of water and essential nutrients, negative effects on crop growth and development, increased weed competition, reduced soil microbial activity, and overall crop productivity reduction. The study also highlights two regions, the Po River Delta and the Mekong Delta, as global hotspots for saltwater intrusion.

"""What factors have led to the increased frequency of saltwater intrusion in the Po River delta and how has this affected the area's natural resources and agricultural productivity?"""	Several factors have contributed to the increased frequency of saltwater intrusion in the Po River delta. These include the pumping of groundwater, reduced river flow due to damming and irrigation, rising sea levels, and subsidence. Subsidence, which mainly occurred in the 1950s and 60s, was caused by large extractions of methane from the subsoil. Climate change has exacerbated these factors, leading to more frequent arid conditions. The impact on the area's natural resources and agricultural productivity has been severe. Soil salinization, habitat loss, and reduced agricultural productivity are some of the consequences. In the last two decades, there have been six episodes of drought, characterized by low discharge of the Po River, which has favored the intrusion of saltwater along the delta's tributaries. During these episodes, the recorded water salinity was more than 2g/l, a critical threshold for irrigation. This has led to significant impacts on crops, as seen in the major droughts of the summer of 2006 and 2022.

What are the main factors driving the saltwater intrusion in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam and how does it impact the cultivation of rice paddies?	The main factors driving the saltwater intrusion in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam include upstream hydropower dams, land subsidence, relative sea-level rise, and riverbed sand mining. This intrusion of saltwater has led to the deterioration of soil quality, making it difficult to cultivate rice paddies. The salinity of the water surface increases as seawater intrudes into the Hau and Tien rivers, extending to significant distances from the coastline. This has drawn significant attention from various sectors and scientists. The severity of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta is expected to increase in the dry season of 2023, further threatening the rice supply in the foreseeable future.

How could climate change potentially affect the temperature and climate conditions in areas with a cold semi-arid climate, like where rice is commonly grown?	Climate change could potentially lead to higher temperatures in areas with a cold semi-arid climate, where rice is commonly grown. This could result in the climate shifting from a cold semi-arid climate to a hot semi-arid climate zone. There could also be an intensification in the frequency of heat waves, which could have potential impacts on agriculture.

Based on the context, what are the impacts of saline water intrusion on the agricultural landscape of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	The saline water intrusion has led to the deterioration of soil quality in the Mekong Delta, making it difficult to cultivate rice paddies. The salinity of the water surface rises by approximately 4g/l as seawater intrudes into the Hau and Tien rivers, extending to 45–65 km and 55–60 km from the coastline, respectively. This has drawn significant attention from domestic and international private and public sectors and scientists. The severity of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta is expected to increase in the dry season of 2023, further threatening rice supply in the foreseeable future. A method of spatially monitoring soil salinity in the Mekong River has been proposed using satellite data-derived variables to support land resource management and to determine suitable crops to cultivate.	['Pontelagoscuro.Critical salinity values ofriver water were recorded uptoabout 40km\nupstream ofthesea(Fig 1)along themain river course and aprincipal branch (PodiGoro).The event wasextraordinarily severe and worse than thesummer of2006, which isremem-\nbered asoneofthemost challenging (critical salinity uptomore than 30kmfrom thesea;\nFig1).Fig1provides anoverview ofthe2006 drought and compares ittothe2022 drought.An\nimportant difference tounderline between thetwodroughts isthelong duration ofthe2022\nphenomenon interms ofexceptionally lowriver flow and concomitant absence ofprecipita-\ntion (2.5 months ofpersistent crisis).Freshwater from thePoRiver isaprimary resource for\ntheentire agricultural landscape ofthedelta, which isused forirrigation through acapillary\ncanal network.When water salinity exceeds thecritical threshold, itbecomes complex and\nsometimes impossible tocomply with irrigation scheduling, aggravating thesevere water\nshortage.The consequences aredramatic foragricultural production and canmanifest assoil\nfertility deterioration, vegetation loss, and micro desertification oflarge field portions (Fig 1).The Mekong Delta region ofVietnam isknown asagiant food bowl duetoitshigh rice\nyield, which hasmade Vietnam theworld’s second-largest riceexporter.However, theregion\nhasbeen severely impacted bysealevel risecaused byclimate change, aproblem exacerbated\ninrecent years bytheconstruction ofupstream dams along theMekong River.This phenome-\nnon isdriven byfour main factors: (a)upstream hydropower dams, (b)land subsidence, (c)\ntherelative sea-level rise, and (d)riverbed sand mining [1,6].The intrusion ofsaltwater has\nledtothedeterioration ofsoilquality, making itdifficult tocultivate ricepaddies [1].The salin-\nityofthewater surface rises byapproximately 4g/lasseawater intrudes into theHau and Tien\nrivers, extending to45–65 kmand 55–60 kmfrom thecoastline, respectively [3].This facthas\ncalled thegreat attention ofdomestic and international private and public sectors and scien-\ntists.Recently, amethod ofspatially monitoring soilsalinity intheMekong River (byusing a\nnear-infrared channel and Vegetation SoilSalinity Index derived from Landsat 8OLI data)\nhasbeen proposed byusing satellite data-derived variables tosupport themanagement ofland\nresources and todetermine thesuitable crops tocultivate [7].According totheNational Cen-\nterforHydro-meteorological Forecasting, Vietnam Ministry ofNatural Resources and Envi-\nronment, theseverity ofsaline intrusion intheMekong Delta isexpected toincrease inthedry\nseason of2023, further threatening ricesupply intheforeseeable future.3.Future challenges\nIntheabsence ofmitigation actions, thefrequency ofextreme weather events willincrease in\nthefollowing decades [8].According toBeck etal.(2018) [9],inRCP scenario 8.5,future cli-\nmate shifts could also affect some important river deltas worldwide.The PoRiver Delta (Italy)\nhasatemperate climate with nodryseasons and hotsummers (Cfa, humid sub-tropical cli-\nmate).Aclimate variation toward drier and warmer conditions ispredicted (BSh, hotsemi-\narid climate).Therefore, theprocess ofsaltwater intrusion isexpected toworsen.Another\nexample istheSaloum River Delta, Senegal’s UNESCO cultural landscape.Currently, its\nsouthern region ischaracterized byatropical savannah climate (Aw).Inthefuture, precipita-\ntion may decrease, leading toahotsemi-arid (BSh) climate zone.The new condition could\nseriously affect theriver’s flow, impacting thedelta’s valuable biodiversity and traditional\nhuman activities.Also notable isthecase oftheEbro River Delta, located ontheMediterra-\nnean coast ofSpain.Itisawetland area classified asanatural park duetoitsbiological, geolog-\nical, and cultural importance.Part ofthedelta isdevoted toagriculture.', 'Writing –original draft: Paolo Tarolli.Writing –review &editing: Jian Luo, Eugenio Straffelini, Yuei-An Liou, Kim-Anh Nguyen,\nRodolfo Laurenti, Roberta Masin, Vincenzo D’Agostino.References\n1.LocHH,LowLixian M,Park E,Dung TD,Shrestha S,Yoon Y-J.How thesaline water intrusion has\nreshaped theagricultural landscape oftheVietname seMekong Delta, areview.ScTotal Enviro n.2021\nNov;

What is the willingness of farm households in the Mekong River Delta to contribute towards a salinity intrusion risk reduction program, and how does this vary depending on the current and expected future impacts of salinity intrusion on agricultural productivity?	Over half of the farm households in the Mekong River Delta are willing to contribute to a fund aimed at reducing the risk of salinity intrusion. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity on their farms. Those households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in areas with lower or no current risk. However, even households that are currently unaffected by salinity intrusion are willing to contribute to a salinity management program. When all contributions are combined, the total amount could potentially cover the total costs of the program. However, the feasibility and the most appropriate government arrangements for this program require further analysis.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
What are the two processes causing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta and what percentage of the total MRD agricultural production area could be impacted by 2030 under current sea level increase predictions?	The two processes causing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta are rising sea levels due to adverse climate change and a significant decline in river flows as a result of upstream dam construction and increased extractions of water. Under current sea level increase predictions, it is estimated that up to 45% of the total Mekong River Delta agricultural area could be impacted by 2030.

What are some of the short-term and long-term solutions being considered to manage the increasing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and what challenges are faced in implementing these solutions?	One short-term solution being considered to manage the increasing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta is the construction of concrete sea-dikes. This would involve building around 1469 km of these structures. However, the cost of such a program and how much households could contribute to it is a significant challenge. In the long term, it may be possible for many farmers to adapt to salinity intrusion by changing their farming practices. For instance, they could transition from rice production to fish or shrimp farming. However, this would require a significant shift in farming practices and potentially livelihoods, which could be a challenge for many households.The increasing salinity intrusion is caused by rising sea levels due to adverse climate change and a significant decline in river flows as a result of upstream dam construction and increased extractions of water. This issue is expected to worsen in the future, with predictions that up to 45% of the Mekong River Delta's agricultural area could be impacted by 2030. This could result in serious regional food security issues and reduced national trade income, adding to the challenges of managing this issue.

What factors have been identified in previous studies as influencing a farm household's willingness to pay for climate change risk reduction programs, such as those aimed at managing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta?	The factors identified as influencing a farm household's willingness to pay for climate change risk reduction programs include the expected impacts of salinity intrusion and the current level of risk faced by the household.

['As stated above,  in  our  CVM  survey  farm  households  were  asked\nto  respond  to  the  willingness  to  pay  bid  value  question  in  one  of\nthree  ways:  ‘Yes,’  ‘No’  or  ‘Do  not  know’.In  the  analysis  model  /H9251  and\nˇ  are  coefﬁcients,  and  X  is  a  vector  of  the  socio-economic  explana-\ntory  variables  related  to  an  individual’s  selection  including:  farm\nhousehold  income,  head  of  household’s  age,  head  of  household’s\ngender,  farm  household  size,  head  of  household’s  education  and\ntotal  farming  experience  (Table  1).The  non-parametric  technique  is\nemployed  to  estimate  the  mean  values  for  WTP.This  technique  was\nsuggested  by  previous  researchers  in  the  same  survey  area  (Ðan\nand  Duyên,  2010 ;

What are the proposed program options to reduce salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how would they be funded according to the survey conducted?	The proposed program options to reduce salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta include converting current earth sea-dike-walls to concrete structures, upgrading existing or building new river-mouth sluicegate systems, and planting new or reforesting degraded existing mangrove systems next to sea-dike-walls. According to the survey conducted, households were asked if they would be willing to contribute monthly to fund these programs. The collected funds would be administered by a committee composed of local government, local and international consultants, and representatives from non-government organizations. This committee would then decide how to invest in concrete sea-dike-walls, sluice-gate construction, and mangrove forest in their local area. The programs aim to reduce current and future salinity intrusion risk in the relevant village areas.	['The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;', 'This  included  a  range\nof  hypothetical  salinity  reduction  program  options.Possible  pro-\ngram  options  suggested  in  this  survey  included  converting  current\nearth  sea-dike-walls  to  concrete  structures,  upgrading  existing  or\nbuilding  new  river-mouth  sluicegate  systems,  and  the  planting  of\nnew  or  reforestation  of  degraded  existing  mangrove  systems  next\nto  sea-dike-walls.Each  respondent  was  then  asked  whether  or  not\nthey  (their  household)  would  be  willing  to  contribute  monthly  to\nfund  such  programs.They  were  told  that  the  program  funds  would\nbe  administered  by  a  committee  including  their  local  government,\nlocal  and  international  consultants,  and  representatives  from  non-\ngovernment  organizations.This  committee  would  then  decide  how\nto  invest  in  concrete  sea-dike-walls,  sluice-gate  construction  and\nmangrove  forest  in  their  local  area.It  was  made  clear  that  these  pro-\ngrams  would  seek  to  reduce  current  and  expected  future  salinity\nintrusion  risk  in  their  relevant  village  area.Following  the  guidelines  from  Arrow  et  al.(1993)  and\nCompetition Commission  (2010) ,  willingness  to  pay  bids  were  col-\nlected using  a  referendum  style  format  where  respondents  could\nselect  one  of  three  options:  ‘Yes’,  ‘No’,  or  ‘Do  not  know’  (‘DK’).During  the  survey,  respondents  were  given  an  opportunity  to\nreconsider  their  vote  before  asking  them  to  nominate  their  speciﬁc\nmonthly  payment  bid.Each  possible  willingness  to  pay  bid  value\nwas  provided  to  at  least  30  of  the  randomly  selected  farm  house-\nholds,  for  a  total  of  150  observations  from  each  area.After  data\ncleaning,  there  were  4414useable  observations  from  three  different\nsalinity-impact  areas.Despite  some  disadvantages  with  referen-\ndum  approaches,  such  as  a  limited  range  for  the  bid-values  offered,\nthis  option  simpliﬁes  the  respondent’s  cognitive  task  (Pearce  et  al.,\n2002 )  which  is  an  important  factor  in  survey  areas  where  farm\n1US$1  dollar  was  equal  to  22,695  Vietnamese  dong  (VND)  at  May  01,  2017.2Enumerators  were  carefully  chosen  from  staff  and  ﬁnal-year  students  from\nDepartment\n of  Agricultural  Economics,  College  of  Economics  at  the  Can  Tho  Univer-\nsity.Those  with  previous  experience  of  survey  data  collection  and  CVM  approaches\nwere\n speciﬁcally  targeted.Each  enumerator  also  received  additional  training  before\nthe\n ofﬁcial  survey  took  place.3Sample  copies  of  the  questionnaire  are  available  from  the  corresponding  author\nin\n Vietnamese  and  English.4Sample  size  was  identiﬁed  by  function:  n  =  z2\n1−˛/2P(1  −  P)/d2.']
What methods were used in the study to reduce the likelihood of over-estimations in the willingness to pay for mitigating the effects of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?	The study used a dichotomous choice format to reduce the likelihood of over-estimations in the willingness to pay for mitigating the effects of salinity intrusion. This decision was enhanced by a large sample of farm households. The primary data was obtained through a field survey conducted among farm households in the Mekong River Delta (MRD). The questionnaire was pre-tested with 30 randomly-selected farm household heads across three MRD study areas. The pre-test was used to check farmer comprehension of the questionnaire, refine the range of willingness to pay bid measures proposed, and test the feasibility of getting farmers to make a monthly contribution to a fund managed by their local authority. Five different bid values were chosen for the monthly payment vehicle based on the pre-test results. The survey sample areas were based on an MRD salinity intrusion map provided by the local department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The survey was directed at three farmer groups based on the level of salinity intrusion impacts. Simple random sampling techniques were used to select farm households from a list provided by district local authorities. To be selected, the head of the farm household or their partner had to live in the area, work on an MRD rice field, and have at least three years’ farming experience.

 ii)  those  living  in  areas  with  a  high  probability  and  risk\nof  future  salinity  intrusion  (the  Tra  On  district  and  part  of  the  Cau\nKe  district);  and  iii)  a  control  group-area  where  salinity  intrusion  is\nnot  yet of  concern  (the  Vinh  Thanh  district  in  the  Can  Tho  province).Using  simple  random  sampling  techniques,  farm  households  were\nrandomly  selected  from  a  list  provided  by  district  local  authorities.Once  selected,  a  survey  enumerator2visited  the  household  to  ascer-\ntain  eligibility  for  survey  participation.To  be  selected,  the  head  of\nthe  farm  household  or  their  partner  had  to  live  in  the  area,  work\non  an  MRD  rice  ﬁeld,  and  have  at  least  three  years’  farming  expe-\nrience.Eligible  respondents  were  then  asked  some  demographic\nand  social  characteristic  questions.This  was  followed  by  questions\nrelated  to  their  perceptions  of  local  climate  change,  and  then  salin-\nity  impacts.3\nDue  to  the  importance  of  collecting  reliable  willingness  to  pay\ninformation,  causes  of  salinity  intrusion  in  the  Mekong  River  Delta\nwere  ﬁrst  explained  carefully  to  respondents.']
What factors are considered in the utility function to determine a farmer's willingness to pay for a public good that mitigates salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?	The factors considered in the utility function to determine a farmer's willingness to pay for a public good that mitigates salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta include the bid value, the farmer's age, gender, level of education, farming experience, household size, farm household income, and the group the farmer belongs to.

"""What are the socio-economic factors considered in the survey to determine a farm household's willingness to pay in the Mekong River Delta?"""	The socio-economic factors considered in the survey to determine a farm household's willingness to pay in the Mekong River Delta include the farm household income, the age of the head of the household, the gender of the head of the household, the size of the farm household, the education level of the head of the household, and the total farming experience.	['The  robustness  of  the  decision  to\nadopt  a  dichotomous  choice  format  was  enhanced  in  this  instance\nby  a  large  sample  of  farm  households.2.1.Survey  method\nThe  primary  data  for  the  study  was  obtained  through  a  ﬁeld\nsurvey  conducted  among  farm  households  in  the  MRD.The\nquestionnaire  was  pre-tested  with  30  randomly-selected  farm\nhousehold  heads  spread  across  three  MRD  study  areas  ranging  from\nheavily  salinity-affected  areas,  down  to  non-salinity-affected  areas.The  purpose  of  the  pre-test  was  to  check  likely  farmer  comprehen-\nsion  of  the  questionnaire,  reﬁne  the  range  of  willingness  to  pay\nbid  measures  proposed,  and  test  the  viability  of  the  proposed  pay-\nment  vehicle;  that  is,  the  feasibility  of  getting  farmers  to  make  a\nmonthly  contribution  to  a  fund  managed  by  their  local  authority.Based on  the  pre-test  results,  ﬁve  different  bid  values  were  chosen\nfor  the  monthly  payment  vehicle:  VND  50,000,  100,000,  150,000,200,000  and  250,000  (equivalent  to  US$12.20,  $4.41,  $6.61,  $8.81\nand $11.02).Following  the  survey  pretests  and  content  ﬁnalization,  the  for-\nmal  in-ﬁeld  face-to-face  survey  data  collection  commenced.The\nsurvey  sample  areas  were  based  on  an  MRD  salinity  intrusion  map\nprovided  by  the  local  department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Devel-\nopment.The  opinion of local  departmental  staff  as  to  which  areas\nmight  present  useful  sample  sites  was  also  sought.As  a  result  of  this\nexercise,  the  survey  was  directed  at  three  farmer  groups:  i)  those\nwhere  salinity intrusion  impacts  are  already  prevalent  (the  Cau  Ke\ndistrict);  ii)  those  living  in  areas  with  a  high  probability  and  risk\nof  future  salinity  intrusion  (the  Tra  On  district  and  part  of  the  Cau\nKe  district);  and  iii)  a  control  group-area  where  salinity  intrusion  is\nnot  yet of  concern  (the  Vinh  Thanh  district  in  the  Can  Tho  province).Using  simple  random  sampling  techniques,  farm  households  were\nrandomly  selected  from  a  list  provided  by  district  local  authorities.Once  selected,  a  survey  enumerator2visited  the  household  to  ascer-\ntain  eligibility  for  survey  participation.To  be  selected,  the  head  of\nthe  farm  household  or  their  partner  had  to  live  in  the  area,  work\non  an  MRD  rice  ﬁeld,  and  have  at  least  three  years’  farming  expe-\nrience.Eligible  respondents  were  then  asked  some  demographic\nand  social  characteristic  questions.This  was  followed  by  questions\nrelated  to  their  perceptions  of  local  climate  change,  and  then  salin-\nity  impacts.3\nDue  to  the  importance  of  collecting  reliable  willingness  to  pay\ninformation,  causes  of  salinity  intrusion  in  the  Mekong  River  Delta\nwere  ﬁrst  explained  carefully  to  respondents.', 'As stated above,  in  our  CVM  survey  farm  households  were  asked\nto  respond  to  the  willingness  to  pay  bid  value  question  in  one  of\nthree  ways:  ‘Yes,’  ‘No’  or  ‘Do  not  know’.In  the  analysis  model  /H9251  and\nˇ  are  coefﬁcients,  and  X  is  a  vector  of  the  socio-economic  explana-\ntory  variables  related  to  an  individual’s  selection  including:  farm\nhousehold  income,  head  of  household’s  age,  head  of  household’s\ngender,  farm  household  size,  head  of  household’s  education  and\ntotal  farming  experience  (Table  1).The  non-parametric  technique  is\nemployed  to  estimate  the  mean  values  for  WTP.This  technique  was\nsuggested  by  previous  researchers  in  the  same  survey  area  (Ðan\nand  Duyên,  2010 ;

"""What were the main reasons why some farm households in the Mekong Delta were unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program?"""	The main reasons why some farm households in the Mekong Delta were unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program were: they couldn't afford the amount, they didn't believe the amount they would pay would actually be used for the program, they thought it was the government's responsibility, and they believed they could deal with the issue using their own adaptation options.	['This  included  a  range\nof  hypothetical  salinity  reduction  program  options.Possible  pro-\ngram  options  suggested  in  this  survey  included  converting  current\nearth  sea-dike-walls  to  concrete  structures,  upgrading  existing  or\nbuilding  new  river-mouth  sluicegate  systems,  and  the  planting  of\nnew  or  reforestation  of  degraded  existing  mangrove  systems  next\nto  sea-dike-walls.Each  respondent  was  then  asked  whether  or  not\nthey  (their  household)  would  be  willing  to  contribute  monthly  to\nfund  such  programs.They  were  told  that  the  program  funds  would\nbe  administered  by  a  committee  including  their  local  government,\nlocal  and  international  consultants,  and  representatives  from  non-\ngovernment  organizations.This  committee  would  then  decide  how\nto  invest  in  concrete  sea-dike-walls,  sluice-gate  construction  and\nmangrove  forest  in  their  local  area.It  was  made  clear  that  these  pro-\ngrams  would  seek  to  reduce  current  and  expected  future  salinity\nintrusion  risk  in  their  relevant  village  area.Following  the  guidelines  from  Arrow  et  al.(1993)  and\nCompetition Commission  (2010) ,  willingness  to  pay  bids  were  col-\nlected using  a  referendum  style  format  where  respondents  could\nselect  one  of  three  options:  ‘Yes’,  ‘No’,  or  ‘Do  not  know’  (‘DK’).During  the  survey,  respondents  were  given  an  opportunity  to\nreconsider  their  vote  before  asking  them  to  nominate  their  speciﬁc\nmonthly  payment  bid.Each  possible  willingness  to  pay  bid  value\nwas  provided  to  at  least  30  of  the  randomly  selected  farm  house-\nholds,  for  a  total  of  150  observations  from  each  area.After

presented  in  Table  4.We\nestimate  the  results  across  three  models:  Model  1  is  an  MNL  model\nwith  ‘No’  responses  as  the  base-outcome,  while  Model  2  is  a  Binary\nLogistic

from  the  dataset.The  results  of  model  ﬁt  statistics  showed  that  the  likelihood\nratio  (LR)  in  three  models  are  signiﬁcant:  p  <  0.001  in  all  Models,\nand  Pseudo  R-square

Based on the context, what does the report suggest about the farmers' understanding or awareness of the bid levels in the control group compared to other groups?	The report suggests that the farmers in the control group had a better understanding or awareness of the bid levels compared to other groups. This is indicated by the fact that the proportion of farmers in the control group who answered 'Do not know' to the bid levels rapidly fell to zero, while it remained positive for the other groups.	['Finally,  the  proportion  of  farmers\nanswering  ‘Do  not  know’  to  the  bid  levels  rapidly  falls  to  zero  in\nthe  control  group  but  remains  positive  for  the  other  groups  at  rela-\n6Following  discussion  by  Jorgensen  et  al.(1999) ,  we  estimated  the  Model  results\nusing\n expanded  zero-bid  protest  vote  deﬁnitions  that  included  program  ineffective-\nness\n beliefs  and  feelings  that  the  respondent  can  deal  with  problem  by  themselves.The\n model estimates  did  not  vary  greatly  from  the  original  analyses,  and  so  were\nnot included  here.These  estimates  are  available  on  request.', 'In  addition,  to  identify  any  differences  in  the  mean  values  of\nthe  variables  in  Table  2  across  the  three  farm  households  groups,\nwe  employed  the  one-way  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  and\nTukey  post-hoc  tests.The  ANOVA  results  conﬁrmed  no  statistically\nsigniﬁcant  differences  between  the  three  groups,  except  gen-\nder  (F(2438)  =  5.28,  p  =  0.0054)  and  education  level  (F(2438)  =  7.13,\np  =  0.0009).Similarly,  the  Tukey  post-hoc  test  revealed  slightly\nhigher  farm  head  of  household  education  levels  in  the  control  group\n(Group  3),  and  slightly  higher  numbers  of  females  in  Groups  1  and\n2.However,  the  differences  are  minimal  and  we  therefore  conclude\nthat  the  analysis  results  from  this  study  are  broadly  representative\nof  the  MRD  farmer  population.3.2.Willingness  to  pay  results\n3.2.1.Reasons  for  unwillingness  to  pay\nIn  terms  of  respondents’  willingness  to  pay  our  study  ﬁrst  exam-\nined  reasons  why  respondents  may  be  unwilling  to  pay  for  the\ngoods  of  interest.Key  reasons  offered  include  a  preference  for\nalternative  goods  and  programs,  a  lack  of  capacity  to  pay,  and  ques-\ntions  of  government  capacity  to  manage  the  proposed  program(s).Table  3  summarises  the  reasons  why  some  farm  households  are\nunwilling  to  contribute  to  the  proposed  salinity  reduction  program.The  main  reason  households  voted  against  a  proposed  program  was\ntheir  reported  inability  to  afford  the  required  payments.The  sec-\nond  highest  selected  reason  was  a  farm  household  perception  that\nsalinity  intrusion  reduction  should  primarily  be  the  responsibility\nof  the  Vietnamese  government.Approximately  20  percent  of  farm\nhouseholds  also  did  not  believe  that  their  contributions  would  be\nused  to  fund  the  program  correctly.Finally,  approximately  15  per-\ncent  of  farm  households  in  salinity-impacted  areas  voted  against\nthe  program  contributions  because  they  felt  that  they  could  adapt\nto,  and  live  with,  MRD  salinity  intrusion.6\n3.2.2.Willingness  to  pay  and  its  determinants\nFig.2  summarizes  the  proportion  of  farm  household  responses\nto  various  bid  levels  offered  in  the  survey.In  general,  the  percent-\nage of  farm  households  answering  ‘Yes’  decreases  as  the  bid  level\nincreases.However,  those  MRD  farms  that  are  currently  affected\nby salinity  or  facing  a  high  risk  of  future  impact  were  generally\ninclined  toward  a  ‘Yes’  response;  even  at  higher  bid  levels.As  expected,  the  proportion  of  farmers  that  indicated  their\nunwillingness  to  contribute  increased  as  bid  levels  were  raised,  but\nagain  with  smaller  total  percentages  from  the  currently-affected\nand  high  future  risk  groups.']
What are the main reasons why farmers in the Mekong River Delta are not willing to contribute to salinity reduction efforts?	The main reasons why farmers in the Mekong River Delta are not willing to contribute to salinity reduction efforts include: they cannot afford the amount required for the contribution, they do not believe the amount they would pay will actually be used for the program, they believe it is the government's responsibility to handle the issue, they think other adaptation measures are more efficient, they feel they can deal with the issue using their own adaptation options, and other unspecified reasons.

Based on the study, does the willingness of farmers to pay for salinity intrusion reduction programs decrease with their farming experience?	No, the study does not indicate that the willingness of farmers to pay for salinity intrusion reduction programs decreases with their farming experience. In fact, the data suggests that farming experience has a positive effect on the willingness to pay for such programs.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', '86  T.D.Khong  et  al./  Agricultural  Water  Management  200  (2018)  80–89Table 4\nMarginal effects of stated willingness\n to pay for\n salinity intrusion  risk  reduction.Variables\n Model\n 1 Model 2 Model 3\nMNL approach  0  =  No  (base  outcome),  1  =  DK,  2  =  Yes  Binary  Logistic  Regression\n0 =\n No/DK, 1 =\n YesBinary  Logistic  Regression  (DK\ndeleted) 0\n = No, 1\n = Yes\n0  1  2  VIF\nBid value 0.003*** −0.001** −0.003*** −0.004*** −0.005*** 1.02\n(0.001)\n (0.001)\n (0.001) (0.001) (0.001)\nAge\n −0.007** 0.001  0.006*  0.008*  0.010**  3.01\n(0.003)\n (0.001) (0.003) (0.005)\n (0.005)\nGender 0.017  0.021  −0.039  −0.074  −0.057  1.10\n(0.052) (0.019) (0.053) (0.074)\n (0.081)\nEducation\n 0.016 −0.003 −0.013 −0.020 −0.025 1.13\n(0.017)\n (0.008) (0.017)\n (0.026) (0.027)\nFarming\n experience 0.011*** −0.001 −0.009*** −0.014*** −0.017*** 3.07\n(0.003)\n (0.001)  (0.003)  (0.005)  (0.005)\nHousehold size −0.005 0.006\n −0.001 −0.001 0.007\n 1.05\n(0.015) (0.006)\n (0.015) (0.022) (0.024)\nFarm\n household income −7.60e-07*** −1.29e-07 8.89e-07***\n 1.30e-06***  1.34e-06***  1.07\n(1.90e-07)\n (1.30e-07) (1.99e-07) (0.000) (0.000)\nGroup 0.124***  −0.019  −0.105***  −0.160***  −0.191***  1.05\n(0.022)\n (0.012) (0.023) (0.037) (0.039)\nLog-Likelihood\n −244.8378 −211.13328 −193.16083\nPseudo\n R-square 0.3036\n 0.2937 0.3382\nProb >  chi2  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000\nN\n (sample size) 441  441  428\n***, **  and  *  indicate  to  statistically  signiﬁcant  at  1%,  5%  and  10%  levels,  respectively;  Standard  errors  of  marginal  effects  (dy/dx)  are  in  parentheses.ated  with  the  group  already  experiencing  high  salinity  intrusion\n(Table  5).Farm  households  in  this  group  are  willing  to  contribute\napproximately  US$2.58  per  month  toward  the  salinity  reduction\nprograms,  while  farms  in  the  control  group  are  only  willing  to  con-\ntribute  around  half  of  that  amount;  i.e.US$1.32  per  month.Across\nthe  three  groups,  annual  farm  household  contribution  to  salinity\nreduction  programs  would  average  US$23.57.A  Kruskal-Willis  H\ntest  was  employed  to  examine  whether  these  WTP  values  were\nstatistically  different  for  the  three  farm  household  groups.']
What is the average monthly contribution that farm households in the Mekong Delta are willing to make towards salinity reduction programs, according to the report?	The context does not provide specific information on the average monthly contribution that farm households in the Mekong Delta are willing to make towards salinity reduction programs.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
Based on the study, what is the willingness of farm households in the Mekong River Delta to financially contribute towards projects aimed at mitigating the impacts of salinity intrusion?	The study indicates that over half of the farm households in the Mekong River Delta are willing to financially contribute to a fund aimed at reducing the risk of salinity intrusion. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity. Those households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in lower or no-current risk areas. However, even those households currently unaffected by salinity intrusion are willing to contribute to a salinity management program. When combined, the total amount that farm households are prepared to pay is significant and could potentially cover the total costs of such a program.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
What is one possible adaptation strategy for farmers in the Mekong Delta to cope with salinity intrusion, as suggested in the report?	One possible adaptation strategy for farmers in the Mekong Delta to cope with salinity intrusion, as suggested in the report, is to shift from rice production to fish or shrimp farming.

What is the significance of the sea-dike in Mekong Delta, Vietnam as mentioned in the report by Khong et al.?	The sea-dike in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, as mentioned in the report by Khong et al., plays a significant role in managing salinity intrusion and preventing water inundation onto low-lying floodplain areas. The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is a vast floodplain only 0–4 m above mean sea level, and over the last 300 years, more than 11,000 kilometers of canals and approximately 2000 kilometers of dike walls have been constructed to mitigate flooding in low-lying areas. The Vietnamese government has issued a decree to upgrade dike walls and increase maintenance in the central and southern MRD, which includes the construction of additional earthen sea-dikes and concrete sluice gates along the coastline. However, due to public budget constraints, Vietnam cannot afford to build the total required lengths of sea-dike walls, which is estimated to be 1469 kilometers.	['T.D.Khong  et  al./  Agricultural  Water  Management  200  (2018)  80–89  81\nFig.1.MRD  salinity  intrusion,  2015.Study  area  locations  are  also  indicated:  1)  Cau  Ke  district,  2)  Cau  Ke  and  Tra  On  districts,  and  3)  Vinh  Thanh  district.Source :  Adapted  from  The  Vietnam  Academy  for  Water  Resources  (2015)\nsion as  a  normal  phenomenon  (Le  Anh  Tuan  et  al.,  2007 ).More\nrecently,  under  increasing  salinity  impacts,  farm  households  and\nlocal  authorities  have  recognized  the  abnormal  properties  of  local\nsalinity  intrusion,  and  begun  searching  for  management  solutions\nincluding  changed  irrigation  schedules,  increased  water  storage  in\ndams,  and  altered  rice-planting  times.These  solutions  are  largely\nviewed  as  short-term  (1–5  year  duration)  ﬁxes.However,  under  a\nrecent  recognition  that  increasing  salinity  intrusion  cannot  be  man-\naged by  private  on-farm  actions  alone,  in  2016  the  General  Program\nof  the  Mekong  Delta  Economic  Cooperation  Forum  in  Hau  Giang\n(MDEC  Forum  -  Hau  Giang)  argued  that  it  would  be  necessary  to\nexplore  and  develop  longer-term  (5–30  year)  solutions  based  on\npublic  intervention.One  possible  long-term  approach  is  the  use  of  concrete  sea-dikes\nor  embankment-structures  that  prevent  water  inundation  onto\nlow-lying  ﬂoodplain  areas.The  MRD  is  a  vast  ﬂoodplain  only  0–4  m\nabove  mean  sea  level.Over  the  last  300  years,  more  than  11,000\nkilometers  of  canals  have  been  constructed  in  the  MRD  to  miti-\ngate  ﬂooding  in  low-lying  areas.In  addition,  approximately  2000\nkilometers  of  dike  walls  have  been  constructed  to  minimize  MRD\nﬂooding  during  periods  of  high  upstream  ﬂows  and  very  high  tides\nthat  can  occur  during  storm  events  (Le  Anh  Tuan  et  al.,  2007 ).In  May\n2009  the  Vietnamese  government  issued  Decree  No.667/QD-TTg\nwith  a  view  to  upgrading  dike  walls  and  increasing  maintenance  in\nthe  central  and  southern  MRD.This  program  will  include  the  con-\nstruction  of  additional  earthen  sea-dikes  and  concrete  sluicegates\nalong  the  coastline  (Danh  and  Khai,  2014 ;  Smajgl  et  al.,  2015 ).As\nthere  is  a  shortage  of  soils  suitable  for  upgrading  these  dikes,  and\nthe  incidence  of  erosion  is  high  (Sorensen  et  al.,  1984 ),  considera-\ntion  is  being  given  to  the  construction  of  concrete  sea-dike-walls.According  to  a  UNDP  Disaster  Management  Unit  Project\n(VIE/97/002)  managed  by  the  General  Department  of  Land  Admin-\nistration,  the  total  length  of  required  sea-dike  walls  in  MRD  would\nbe  1469  kilometers.Danh  (2012)  and  Danh  and  Khai  (2014)  arguedthat Vietnam  cannot  afford  to  build  the  total  required  lengths  of\nsea-dike  walls  due  to  public  budget  constraints.', 'T.D.

What is the estimated cost of constructing concrete sea-dike-walls of different heights across rural Vietnam to control salinity intrusion, and how might this cost be distributed among households in the Mekong River Delta?	The estimated cost of constructing concrete sea-dike-walls across rural Vietnam varies depending on the height of the walls. For a two-meter wall, the cost is approximately US$1.16 million per kilometer. This increases to US$1.93 million per kilometer for a three-meter wall, and US$2.79 million per kilometer for a four-meter wall. Over the total length of the Mekong River Delta coastal area, the total funding required would be approximately US$1.7 billion for two-meter walls, US$2.8 billion for three-meter walls, and US$4.1 billion for four-meter walls. To service a 40-year loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) sufficient to build these sea-dikes, the required annual payment would be $52.56 million for a two-meter wall, $87.60 million for a three-meter wall, and $126.99 million for a four-meter wall. This would translate to an annual contribution per household of $15.93 for a two-meter wall, $26.54 for a three-meter wall, and $38.48 for a four-meter wall.

What is the estimated annual contribution per farm household required to repay the Asian Development Bank loan for building a sea-dike to protect farm lands from climate change-induced sea level rise in the Mekong River Delta?	The estimated annual contribution required to repay the Asian Development Bank loan for building a sea-dike in the Mekong River Delta ranges between US$16 and US$39 per farm household.	['Signiﬁcantly,  as  a  relatively  poor  country\nand  where  climate-induced  sea  level  rise  is  the  prime  cause  of  the\nsalinity  intrusion  problem,  the  Vietnamese  Government  should  be\nable  to  borrow  the  money  needed  to  build  a  sea-dike-walls  system\nat  1.08%7p.a.interest  rate  from  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),\nand  repay  the  principle  over  a  loan  term  40  years.If  this  is  the  case,\nthen  the  annual  payment  would  be  between  $53  m  and  $127  m  per\nannual  (Table  6).If  the  repayment  ﬁgure  is  then  equally  divided  across  the  3.3\nmillion  farm  households9currently  located  in  the  MRD  (Ministry\nof  Planning  and  Investment,  2015 ),  it  would  result  in  a  need  to\n7This  is  the  Weighted  Average  Cost  of  Capital  (WACC)  estimated  by  Asian  Devel-\nopment\n Bank  applied  for  Transport  Corridor  -  Noi  Bai  -  Lao  Cai  Highway  Project  loan\nfor\n Vietnam.8Identiﬁed  by  function  A  =  US$loan  amount  [i(1  +  i)n]/[i(1  +  i)n−1]  where  i  is  WACC\nand,\n n  is  number  of  loan  years.9The  number  of  household  in  MRD  is  around  4.7  million  in  2015  (The  Vietnam\nGeneral\n Statistic  Ofﬁce  -  www.gso.gov.vn ),  in  which  69.3%  are  farm  household  in\nrural\n areas (Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment).collect  between  US$16  and  US$39  per  farm  household.However,\nif  the  contribution  involves  all  households  (including  non-farm\nhouseholds) in  the  MRD,  where  a  total  of  4.7  million  households\nare  located,  the  annual  payment  period  will  be  decreased  from  40\nto  30  years,  and  the  annual  contribution  required  per  household\nwould  fall  to  between  US$14  and  US$35  per  household.Clearly,\nthis  is  a  very  crude  estimate,  and  not  sufﬁcient  to  recommend  the\nimplementation  of  an  MRD  concrete  sea-dike  program.Neverthe-\nless,  the  estimated  per  farm  household  contribution  required  to\nmeet  ADB  loan  repayment  is  less  than  the  average  stated  willing-\nness  to  pay  levels  found  in  our  study.Therefore,  our  results  suggest\nthat  in  the  absence  of  other  public  funds,  private  MRD  farm  house-\nhold  contributions  may  be  sufﬁcient  to  cover  the  cost  of  building\na  concrete  sea-dike  that  would  protect  farm  lands  from  climate\nchange-induced  sea  level  rise.The  issue  of  whether  this  is  equitable\nremains  the  subject  of  further  analysis  and  discussion  that  we  will\naddress in  future  research.Nevertheless,  the  insights  provided  by\nthis  paper  have  important  ramiﬁcations  for  Vietnam,  other  devel-\noping  country  contexts  faced  with  salinity  intrusion  impacts,  and\nbroader  climate  change  management  policy.5.Conclusions\nThis  study  estimates  MRD  farm  household  willingness  to  pay\nfor  salinity  intrusion  mitigation  programs.', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
"""Are more than 50 percent of farm households in the Mekong Delta willing to contribute to a fund to reduce the risk of salinity intrusion, and is their willingness to pay proportional to the expected impacts of salinity?"""	Yes, more than 50 percent of farm households in the Mekong Delta are willing to contribute to a fund to reduce the risk of salinity intrusion. Their willingness to pay is indeed proportional to the expected impacts of salinity.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']

What measures have been proposed to adapt to the rising sea level in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta according to the context provided?	Several measures have been proposed to adapt to the rising sea level in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta. These include changing irrigation schedules, increasing water storage in dams, and altering rice-planting times. These are considered short-term solutions. For long-term solutions, public intervention is necessary. One proposed long-term approach is the construction of concrete sea-dikes or embankment-structures to prevent water inundation onto low-lying floodplain areas. The Vietnamese government has also issued a decree to upgrade dike walls and increase maintenance in the central and southern Mekong River Delta. This includes the construction of additional earthen sea-dikes and concrete sluice gates along the coastline. Another consideration is the construction of concrete sea-dike walls. However, due to budget constraints, it may not be possible to build the total required lengths of sea-dike walls. Another adaptation measure is for farmers to live with and adapt to salinity intrusion by transitioning from rice production to fish or shrimp farming.

What are the challenges faced by agriculture in the Mekong Delta due to changing climate conditions such as sea level rise, variable monsoon, and increased saltwater intrusion?	The agriculture in the Mekong Delta faces several challenges due to changing climate conditions. These include the increasing instability in global climate and local weather conditions, which present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges. The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, and increases FeS2 buildup, leading to reduced agriculture productivity and degradation of surface water quality. This also makes aquatic ecosystems vulnerable. A changing climate has altered the predictable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes, making it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops. Sea level rise, human land use management, increased population, and the rise in food and nutrition insecurity are also challenging the region to enhance their adaptation and agricultural production strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and that Vietnamese farmers are able to make a living.	['86A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4security and rural livelihoods (World Bank \n2022; Loc et al.2021).According to the World Bank (2022), Vietnam is among the world’s most vulnerable climate risk coun -\ntries, ranked 13th among 180 countries by Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index 2000 to 2019.In response to these changing condi -\ntions, the delta floodwater control system is being modified to encourage farmers to diversify their cropping systems and be more attentive to the environmental impacts of agriculture (Luu et al.2022).Vietnam Resolution 120/2017/NQ-CP , issued in 2017, promotes “living with floods,” “uncertainty adaptation,” and nature-based approaches for addressing climate change and upstream develop -\nment (Luu et al.2022).Delta farmers are challenged to make a living under these stressful and uncertain conditions.They continue to seek innovative water management and drainage approaches and adapt cropping systems to changing soil-water conditions, building on their accumulated local knowledge and sci -\nentific findings gained from laboratory and field experiments.Understanding the chemical and biogeophysical prop -\nerties and pedogenic processes of acid sulfate soils, developing climate-flexible crops and management systems as well as increasing crop genetic tolerances to Al and salt concentrations are foundational to effective delta agricultural adaptation.TRANSFORMING A LARGE TROPICAL \nDELTA INTO AN AGRICULTURAL \nLANDSCAPE \nFresh water for agriculture and drinking has for centuries been scarce during the long five-month dry season with saline water incursions making the acidic delta soils less productive for crops and the shallow ground water salty and not safe for cooking or drinking (Taylor 2014).Historically this wild, untamed, vast flood-plain was sparsely settled with agriculture and small settlements on marine sandy coastal dunes—fresh water oases—cre-ated as flooding and river sediments built out the delta.It was not until the French colonization (1800s) and Vietnamese state (1980s) undertook large irrigation pro -\ngrams to construct canals to channel fresh water from the Mekong and Bassac riv -\ners to reduce water and soil salinity that agricultural systems replaced the wetland ecosystem (Taylor 2014; Luu et al.2022).At first natural waterways were straight-\nened and deepened, and then connected by canals.The French Colonial Government set about clearing forests and draining wetlands to turn the underutilized and agriculturally unproductive soils into rice production.These sparsely populated, densely vegetated acid sulfate lands were used by resistance fighters as hideouts dur -\ning the US Vietnam War (1961 to 1973).After the war, the Vietnam state established large-scale state farms (1,000 to 10,000 ha [2,471 to 24,710 ac]) to increase the delta population and alleviate serious food shortages (van Mensvoort 1996).Newly resettled farmers were inexperienced in managing waterlogged acid sulfate soils to make them productive, and the state farms were inadequately funded with a shortage of knowledge and equipment resources as well as insufficient farm workers for large-scale parcels.Excess water on the landscape in monsoon season alternating with dry season freshwater scarcity made delta living conditions harsh, and most of these collective farms failed to grow enough food for farmers to make a living (van Mensvoort 1996).By the mid-1980s irrigation projects \nexpanded throughout the delta to create a freshwater network across the entire pen-insula with sluice gates that protected the waterway grid from saline intrusion and reengineered the waterscape to drain and control water for rice agriculture (Taylor 2014).Rice establishes and grows well in waterlogged environments but is sensitive to salinity with an electric conductivity (EC\nSPE) threshold of 3 dS m–1 (Korres et \nal.2022).The saline delta rivers, wetlands, and marshes were converted into peren-nial freshwater zones.This reduced the seasonal variation in water flow patterns, converted the flood plain into regulated canals, dykes, and polders that irrigated agriculture, and prevented annual flood waters from submerging fields (and sedi -\nments from replenishing soil fertility) (Luu et.2022).T oday’s Vietnam Mekong Delta agri -\ncultural landscape is built on managing and controlling the quantity and distri-bution of water year round (flooding, irrigation, fresh and saline waters) in allu -\nvial and acid sulfate soils (figure 2).', '91A\nJULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4 JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONLIVING WITH SALINITY: AGRICULTURAL \nADAPTATIONS TO SALINE ACID \nSULFATE SOILS\nOne meter (3.3 ft) of sea-level rise would \ninundate 79% of Ca Mau and 76% of Kien Giang provinces in the Vietnam Mekong Delta.The World Bank (2022) predicts that without adaptation, 45% of the delta will be affected by salinity.Below are eight rec -\nommendations to guide Vietnam Mekong Delta policymakers, scientists, local leaders, and farmers in effectively adapting and liv -\ning with salinity while continuing to make acid sulfate soils productive and delta eco -\nsystems sustainable and healthy: \n1. widen the adoption of di versified \ncropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization;\n2. incr ease research, field evaluations, and \napplications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improve plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater;\n3. incr ease freshwater flows and aquifer \nrecharge to offset saltwater intrusion;\n4. pr oactively prepare and protect lands \nand settlements to increase resilience against tropical cyclones;

and\n8. r estrict new development in eco-\nsensitive and fragile environmental regions, and strengthen and enforce land use regulations.CONCLUSION: UNCERTAINTY \nADAPTATION \nThe 1980s “rice first” policy promoted engineered ditches, canals, and sluice gates that provided freshwater irrigation, managed flooding, eliminated saltwater intrusion and drained acid sulfate soils to reclaim thousands of hectares for the intensification of rice production (Olson and Morton 2018; Ngan et al.2018; Luu et al.2022).While Vietnamese Mekong Delta farmers have learned over the decades to manage flood-drought cycles in acid sulfate soils, the increasing instability in global cli-mate and local weather conditions present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges.The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS\n2 buildup leading to reduced \nagriculture productivity, degrades surface water quality, and makes aquatic ecosys -\ntems vulnerable (Tully et al.2019; Mosley et al.2017).A changing climate has altered the \npredicable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes and made it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops.Climate change, sea level rise, human land use management, increased population, and the rise in food and nutrition insecurity is again challenging the region to ratchet up their adaptation and agricultural pro -\nduction strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and that Vietnamese farmers are able to make a living.Local and indigenous farmer knowl-\nedge and university scientific research have combined to create innovative land man-agement approaches, engineer extensive water management projects, and develop salt-tolerant crop varieties to make acid sulfate soils agriculturally productive.Continuous research and experimentation will be needed to respond and prepare for present and future uncertainties.Adaptive integration of biogeophysical, \npedogenic, and social knowledge is critical in deepening understanding of landscape and local surface level drainage impacts and soil-water relationships under increas -\ningly variable conditions.Observing and learning more about the connections and synergies among rates of percolation, soil management effects on macropores and mesopores, the role of bypass flows in raised bed soil leaching processes, densities and types of beneficial bacteria in pro-ductive soils, and plant breeding for salt tolerance will be essential to living with uncertainty and strengthening delta sus -\ntainability and resilience.']

What measures are being taken to control salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how does the changing climate, including factors like sea level rise and drought periods, exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables in the region?	Measures to control salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta include water control projects such as high dyke and flood control, salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture, and salinity control in brackish water aquaculture. Canals are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements, and during the rainy season, these canals are used to drain the land and release flood waters back into rivers. Sluice gates are also used to allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide, and are closed during the dry season and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields.The changing climate exacerbates saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables in the region in several ways. Sea level rise, seasonal and increasingly variable cyclones, coastal storms, and high tides flood coastal regions and push seawater upriver, mixing with fresh water. The onset of the dry season is accompanied by receding waters and shifting salinity concentrations in the waterways. Drought periods can further exacerbate saltwater intrusion as freshwater flow rates decrease and allow saline water to move further inland. This landward movement of saltwater alters soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics.	['Water control projects consist of high dyke and flood control, salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture, and salinity control in brackish water aquaculture (Ngan et al 2018).Canals that link to the Bassac and Mekong main stem rivers and their dis -\ntributaries are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements.During the rainy season, many of these same canals are used to drain the land and release flood waters back into rivers and the West and East China Seas (Ngan et al 2018; Hanhart et al.1997).Extensive agricultural drain-age ditches and canals lower the water table and speed up hydrologic exchanges between the coastal landscape and the ocean which can increase salt concentra -\ntion (Tully et al.2019).Sluice gates allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide and are closed during the dry sea -\nson and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields (figure 2).ACID SULFATE SOILS OF THE VIETNAM \nMEKONG DELTA \nAcid sulfate soils occupy more than 40% of the Vietnam Mekong Delta (figure 1).Soils are characterized by high Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations and low pH 2.7 to \n3.5, >0.5 mol Fe2+ and 0.05 mol Al3+ m–3.A large portion of these soils are under-water annually for several months during the monsoon season.Sea level rise, sea -\nsonal and increasingly variable cyclones, coastal storms, and high tides flood coastal regions and push seawater upriver mix-ing with fresh water.The onset of the dry season is accompanied by receding waters and shifting salinity concentrations in the waterways with sluice gates and dyke sys-tems built to irrigate and drain the interior landscape and control salinity intrusion.Drought periods can exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease and allow saline water to move further inland (Tully et al.2019).Saltwater intrusion, the land-ward movement of saltwater, alters soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', '86A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4security and rural livelihoods (World Bank \n2022;

What factors influence the height of the constructed raised beds in managing salinity and acid sulfate soils in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	The height of the constructed raised beds in managing salinity and acid sulfate soils in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, is influenced by several factors. These include the depth to the acid sulfate horizon, the depth to the water table during the growing season, the role of capillary rise, the specific crop being grown, and the time and cost of labor. The higher the raised bed, the thicker the zone of leaching will be, increasing the distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, and thus increasing the available soil volume for roots.	['The depth to the acid sulfate hori -\nzon, depth to water table during growing season, the role of capillary rise, the spe -\ncific crop grown, and the time and cost of labor influence the height of the con -\nstructed raised beds.Evapotranspiration will pull water upwards during the dry season, potentially leaving behind Na\n2SO4 \nand other salts.The higher the raised bed, the thicker the zone of leaching will be and distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, thus increasing the available soil volume for roots.Freshly excavated soil deposited as \nridges or shaped into raised beds create a network of macropores between soil clods that enable water to flow through the top -\nsoil and bypass the unsaturated soil matrix.Water moving through the macropores of newly constructed raised beds can quickly Figure 2\nThis sluice gate in Soc Trang Province, Vietnam, connects a main canal to the \nSouth China Sea and controls saltwater tidal inflow and flooding outflow.Open sluice gates allow fields to drain after heavy rains and flooding and are closed during high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to irrigate agricultural fields.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', '88A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL. 78, NO. 4remove/leach soluble Al and other soluble \nsubstances from the surface of the soil clods into the drainage/irrigation ditch (figure 4). Flushing raised beds with fresh water (water low in electrical conductivity and dissolved metals) two or three times before a crop is planted removes additional toxic substances that can affect crop roots and plant develop -\nment. Soil Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations \nare flushed with fresh water in annual raised bed systems that are submerged during normal flooding and then planted after the flooding recedes. The raised bed is rebuilt with topsoil after each monsoon flooding, then an annual crop is transplanted into the bed to grow; harvest occurs during the dry season with the cycle annually repeated (Minh et al. 1997a)\n Throughout the season, rain and/\nor freshwater irrigation consolidates and crusts over the soil surface in the raised bed, and mesopores form as crop roots grow and decay. This reduces the num-ber of water-conducting macropores and slows the movement of water through the soil profile reducing Al leaching (figure 5). Dry intervals increase Al\n3+ concentrations \nin the soil with infiltration after each pre -\ncipitation event removing some salts but at slower rates. When fresh water removes the Al from the soil it concentrates in the outflow to the ditch and can increase con -\ntamination in irrigation water downstream (Minh et al.1997a). Multiple-year, perennial raised beds with \ndeeper roots are built higher than annual beds (figure 3). Constructed from topsoil and sulfuric horizon soils while deepening ditches and clearing sediments during the dry season, the beds are left fallow during the following rainy season, flushing out Al and other salt concentrations. The use of the sulfuric horizon soil brings higher concen -trations of Al and SO\n42– to the raised bed \nand lowers the pH. After year 1 planting, development, bloom, fruiting, and harvest, the soil on the raised beds are not disturbed, and a perennial crop is grown on the raised bed for several years. The raised beds are 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 in) above normal peak flood levels so the crop is not submerged (Minh et al. 1997b).

What are the methods used to remove soluble Al and other toxic substances from the soil in the Mekong Delta, and how does this process affect the soil's acidity and the growth of crops?	The context does not provide specific methods used to remove soluble Al and other toxic substances from the soil in the Mekong Delta. However, it mentions that one of the keys to acid sulfate soil productivity is water-soil adaptive management. This involves maintaining a crop-specific balance between reducing and oxidizing conditions in the plant root zone at critical vegetative, bloom, and fruit development stages. This approach helps manage the high concentrations of aluminum (Al), sulfates (SO42–), and iron (Fe) in the soil, which can produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4) that reduces soil pH below 4 when drained. These metals accumulate in the topsoil during the tropical dry season and can be toxic to plant root growth and development, suppressing yields. Therefore, managing these conditions is crucial for crop growth in the Mekong Delta.

What are some of the aluminum-tolerant and saline-tolerant crops that can be grown in the acid sulfate soils of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and how do they adapt to these conditions?	Aluminum-tolerant crops such as the pineapple cultivar (Ananas comosus [L.] Merrill) can be grown in the acid sulfate soils of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. This perennial fruit tolerates low pH and high levels of soluble soil aluminum, grows well in low soil fertility, and is fairly well adapted to acid sulfate soils. The roots of the pineapple are shallow, spreading laterally 1 to 1.5 m and 15 to 30 cm deep, making it well suited for deep-ditch raised bed management. Pineapple plants have also benefited from efforts to select varieties with the ability to exclude aluminum from entering the root apex and root hairs. In addition to pineapple, other saline-tolerant fruit crops such as aluminum-tolerant mango (Mangifera indica L.) and salt-tolerant coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) can also be grown in the delta soils of the Mekong Delta. These crops are helping to diversify the current cropping systems in the region.

Pineapple has benefited from efforts to select plants with the ability to exclude Al from entering the root apex and root hairs (Le Van and Masuda 2004). Root elongation and color are two practical plant response indicators of Al toxicity that are useful to farmers in regulating field drainage in acid sulfate soils (Hanhart et al. 1997; LeVan and Masuda 2004).

Sulfide inhibits nitri -\nfication and denitrification (Tully et al. 2019).

The presence of SOM regulates concentrations of Al by retaining the ions and reducing leaching (Nga and van Meenvoort 1997). SOM is the fuel that feeds microbial activity (and SO\n42– reduc-\ntion).

What are the benefits of using purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) as a biofertilizer in improving soil health and crop yield in the Mekong Delta's acid sulfate soils?	Purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) have been found to increase phosphorus availability for plant use. They do this by solubilizing Al-P and Fe-P compounds, which are essential for root growth, leaf and flowering, and fruit development. The application of PNSB has shown to improve the growth, yields, and soil health of crops like mango, pineapple, and rice. These bacteria are active in both aerobic and anaerobic environments, making them well suited to the delta’s wet-dry cycles. The use of PNSB also reduces soil legacy phosphorus, improves fertilizer efficiency, and offers an alternative to synthetic fertilizers. This has the potential to reduce the negative impacts of phosphorus loss on water quality.	['90A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4pest and disease resilience (Huu et al.2022; \nNguyen et al.2023).Phosphorus is insoluble (Fe-P) when \nsoil pH is less than 4.However, P solu-bilizing bacteria release organic acids during the microbial metabolism processes and increase soil pH.Evaluations of sev -\neral strains of purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) in the 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) layer of acid sulfate soil have shown that applica -\ntion of R. sphaeroides P solubilizing strains \nincreased P availability for plant use (Luu et al.2022).These bacteria solubilize Al-P and Fe-P compounds, making P avail -\nable for root growth, leaf and flowering, and fruit development.Mango, pineapple, and rice growth, yields, and soil health have shown improvements from the use of PNSB as a biofertilizer.PNSB solubilizing microbes are active in both aerobic and anerobic environments, making them well suited to the delta’s wet-dry cycles.Use of PNSB reduced soil legacy P , improved fer-tilizer efficiency, and offers an alternative to synthetic fertilizers with potential to reduce negative impacts of P loss on water quality (Luu et al.2022).Mekong Delta research on microbial \nbiopesticides for vegetable crops has shown capacity to improve pest, disease, and yield in green onions ( Allium) and an increase in soil \npH after two consecutive crops compared to the control (Nguyen et al.2023).A five-spice biopesticide product of garlic ( Allium sativum  \nL.), chili ( Capsicum), ginger ( Zingiber offici -\nnale), onion, and lemongrass ( Cymbopogon) \nresulted in significant increase in the number of soil bacteria such as beneficial N-fixing bacteria, phosphate (PO\n43–)-solubilizing bac -\nteria, and Si-solubilizing bacteria compared to the control.Stroud and Manefield (2014) found that \nActinobacteria was a major component of acid sulfate soil horizons in Australia.All soil horizons contained d-proteobacteria and a-proteobacteria.Splitting the phylum Chloroflexi into classes revealed that the Chloroflexi class was a dominate group in the acid sulfate soils, and the phy -\nlum Acidobacteria in soil horizons was dominated by Holophagae.The phylum Firmicutes was dominated by the classes Bacilli and Clostridia across all the acid sulfate soils, with the class Nitrospira low in abundance.This is the group that con-tains acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (Leptospirillum sp.), the most important \nphylotype in acid sulfate soils.The abun-dance of this group may be determined by pH due to their limited metabolic capacity (derives energy solely from Fe(II) oxida -\ntion) and adaptability under extremely acidic environments (pH < 4).Although little is known about acid-\ntolerant Fe(II) oxidizers, around 22 are acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing species across four phyla (Bonnefoy and Holmes 2012) with only Firmicutes, and Alicyclobacillus detected in these soils.Chloroflexus was \nhighly abundant in the acid sulfate soil horizons, but its role in Fe cycling is not well understood.However, research from microbial mat zones indicated a positive relationship to zones of enriched Fe(II) oxi -\ndation and the fully sequenced Chloroflexus aurantiacus (Trouwborst et al.2007).More research is needed to understand acid sul -\nfate microorganisms and roles they play in regulating plant nutrient uptake.IMPROVING PLANT SALINITY AND \nALUMINUM TOLERANCE \nSaline and freshwater wetland soils accu -\nmulate plant residues in the soil surface horizon and have a permanently sub-merged reduced gleyed horizon where Fe sulfide minerals (FeS\n2) are present \n(Ponnamperuma 1972).These anaerobic, submerged soils are neutral and can sup -\nport salt-tolerant plants.', '89A\nJULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL. 78, NO. 4 JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONAluminum-tolerant crops like pineap-\nple cultivar (Ananas comosus  [L.] Merrill), \na perennial fruit, tolerate low pH and high \nlevels of soluble soil Al, grow well in low soil fertility, and are fairly well adapted to acid sulfate soils ( Le Van and Masuda 2004).

What are some of the effects of high salt concentrations on plant growth and how can increasing plant available Silicon improve the salt tolerance of crops in saline soils?	High salt concentrations can have several detrimental effects on plant growth. They can exceed the osmotic pressure in plant cells, leading to a decreased root capacity to absorb minerals like calcium, potassium, and water. This restricts soil water absorption and inhibits seed germination. Salinity stress can also affect plant metabolic processes, disturbing osmotic processes, causing specific ion toxicity by altering the sodium/calcium ratio, creating nutritional imbalances, and inducing oxidation stress. These effects can lead to decreased photosynthesis and plant productivity.Increasing the availability of silicon (Si) to plants can improve their salt tolerance, particularly in crops like rice, tomatoes, and sugarcane grown in saline soils. Solubilized Si helps adjust water uptake by roots, enabling plants to maintain water balance and improve drought tolerance. A small increase in soluble Si by specific microorganisms can significantly enhance salt tolerance in some crops, improving seed access to soil water, the structure of leaf cells, and photosynthetic activity. Certain silicate-solubilizing bacteria have been found to improve rice's salt-tolerant capability, growth, and yield when grown in salt-affected soils.	['However, upland plants have a greater variance in their resis -\ntance to saturated soils and waterlogging.This resistance has been linked to root capacity to oxidize the rhizosphere and ability to withstand short periods of soil submergence (Ponnamperuma 1972).When soil salt solution exceeds the \nosmotic pressure in plant cells, the plant has decreased root capacity to absorb min-erals like Ca, potassium (K), and water.High salt concentrations restrict soil water absorption and inhibit seed germination (Adil et al.2023).Salinity stress on plant metabolic pro-\ncesses affect osmotic processes, specific ion toxicity by disturbing the sodium (Na\n+)/\nCa2+ ratio, nutrition imbalance, and oxi -\ndation stress, which lead to decreased photosynthesis and plant productivity (Adil et al.2023).Increasing plant avail -able Si has been found to improve the salt tolerance of some crops such as rice, tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and sugarcane (Saccharum) grown in saline soils.A growing body of microbial research on Si applications is finding a small increase in soluble Si by specific microorganisms can significantly enhance salt tolerance in some crops including improved seed access to soil water, structure of leaf cells, and photosynthetic activity.Solubilized Si helps adjust water uptake by roots enabling plants to maintain water bal-ance and improve drought tolerance.One silicate-solubilizing bacteria (SSB) study on rice cultivars grown in salt-affected soil under greenhouse conditions in two consecutive seasons evaluated the efficacy of five SSB, Ochrobactrum ciceri TCM_39 (TCM_39), Microbacterium neimengense \nMCM_15 (MCM_15), Klebsiella aerogenes LCT_01 (LCT_01), Citrobacter freundii \nRTTV_12 (RTTV_12), and Olivibacter jilunii PTST_30 (PTST_30), isolated from \nbamboo, sugarcane, rice planted soils, earthworm intestine, and earthworm feces as bacterial sources (Nguyen and Tran 2023).Researchers found SSB improved rice salt-tolerant capability, growth, and yield when grown in salt-affected soils.Biochemical and physiological research \nevaluating salt and Al tolerance in pineapple cultivars is finding significant differences in detection of Al in the soil and accumu -\nlation of Al in roots among cultivars (Le Van and Masuda 2004).Low Al accumula -\ntion in roots accompanied by increased Al tolerance suggests an Al exclusion mecha -\nnism in the roots triggered by exposure to soil Al (LeVan and Masuda 2004).This type of research lays the groundwork for \nimproved plant breeding and technolo -\ngies that target development of plants with root systems able to exclude Al and mini-mize salt impacts on plant water uptake.These are the kind of innovations that \nwill be needed to simultaneously manage water-soil relationships in acid sulfate soils, improve agricultural capacities to pro-duce food and nutrition, enable farmers to make a living, and ensure the integrity of unique delta ecosystems.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', 'The depth to the acid sulfate hori -\nzon, depth to water table during growing season, the role of capillary rise, the spe -\ncific crop grown, and the time and cost of labor influence the height of the con -\nstructed raised beds.Evapotranspiration will pull water upwards during the dry season, potentially leaving behind Na\n2SO4 \nand other salts.The higher the raised bed, the thicker the zone of leaching will be and distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, thus increasing the available soil volume for roots.Freshly excavated soil deposited as \nridges or shaped into raised beds create a network of macropores between soil clods that enable water to flow through the top -\nsoil and bypass the unsaturated soil matrix.Water moving through the macropores of newly constructed raised beds can quickly Figure 2\nThis sluice gate in Soc Trang Province, Vietnam, connects a main canal to the \nSouth China Sea and controls saltwater tidal inflow and flooding outflow.Open sluice gates allow fields to drain after heavy rains and flooding and are closed during high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to irrigate agricultural fields.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation']

"Several strategies are mentioned for managing the harmful effects of soil salinity in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These include modifying the delta floodwater control system to encourage farmers to diversify their cropping systems and be more attentive to the environmental impacts of agriculture. The Vietnam Resolution 120/2017/NQ-CP promotes ""living with floods,"" ""uncertainty adaptation,"" and nature-based approaches for addressing climate change and upstream development. Farmers are encouraged to seek innovative water management and drainage approaches, adapt cropping systems to changing soil-water conditions, and build on their accumulated local knowledge and scientific findings. Understanding the properties and processes of acid sulfate soils, developing climate-flexible crops and management systems, and increasing crop genetic tolerances to Al and salt concentrations are also foundational to effective delta agricultural adaptation. Water control projects, including high dyke and flood control, salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture, and salinity control in brackish water aquaculture, are also implemented.

Intensifying saline water intrusion and drought in the Mekong Delta can exacerbate the challenges faced by farmers in the region. These conditions can alter soil geochemistry and change soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. This can make the acidic delta soils less productive for crops and the shallow groundwater salty and unsafe for cooking or drinking. Drought periods can further intensify saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease, allowing saline water to move further inland.

What are the implications of saltwater intrusion on the soil chemistry in agricultural fields in the Mekong Delta, as discussed in the report?	Saltwater intrusion, which is the landward movement of saltwater, significantly alters the soil geochemistry in the Mekong Delta. It changes the soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. This intrusion can be exacerbated during drought periods when freshwater flow rates decrease, allowing saline water to move further inland. The intrusion of saltwater can also increase the concentration of salt in the soil, particularly when agricultural drainage ditches and canals lower the water table and speed up hydrologic exchanges between the coastal landscape and the ocean. Furthermore, the repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, and increases FeS2 buildup. This leads to reduced agricultural productivity, degradation of surface water quality, and vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems.

"""What methods were used in the study to determine the impact of salinity intrusion on the productivity of crops in the Mekong Delta region?"""	The study used panel data collected from the Statistical Yearbook for the period 2010 – 2019. This data included information on yield and area of rice, maize, sweet potato; salinity, river water level, average temperature, precipitation and total hours of sunshine. To analyze this data, multiple regression models were employed.

"""How does the increase in salinity concentration affect the productivity of crops such as rice and sweet potatoes in the Mekong Delta?"""	An increase in salinity concentration negatively impacts the productivity of crops in the Mekong Delta.

Furthermore, the yield of major crops in the region, including rice, maize, and sweet potato, is also affected by the lowest river water levels or severe water shortages in the dry season, which further reduce crop yields.

"""What are the effects of increased salinity on the growth and yield of rice, and how does it impact the use of land for agriculture in the Mekong Delta?"""	Increased salinity has a negative impact on crop yield in the Mekong Delta. Specifically, when salinity increases by 1 gram/liter, it reduces crop yield. This study used data on yield and area of rice, maize, and sweet potato, among other factors, to determine the effect of saline intrusion on crop yield. The methods used in the study included multiple regression models with OLS least squares method, random effects method (REM), fixed effects method (FEM), and feasible generalized least squares method (FGLS). The results of this study can have implications for the use of land for agriculture in the Mekong Delta, as increased salinity can reduce the productivity of the land.

"""How does an increase in salinity affect crop yield in the Mekong River Delta?"""	An increase in salinity negatively impacts crop yield in the Mekong River Delta. Specifically, when salinity increases by 1 gram/liter, it reduces rice yield and sweet potato yield by 0.197 quintal/ha and 2.809 quintals/ha, respectively. Furthermore, the yield of major crops in the region, including rice, maize, and sweet potato, is also affected by the lowest river water levels or severe water shortages in the dry season, which further reduce crop yields.

"""What is the optimal planting density and fertilizer dosage for the highest yield of Sacha Inchi in Củ Chi and Cẩm Mỹ, according to the study conducted by Nguyet and Tran in 2022?"""	The optimal planting density and fertilizer dosage for the highest yield of Sacha Inchi in Củ Chi and Cẩm Mỹ, according to the study, is a planting density of 3,333 trees per hectare with a fertilizer dosage of 2 kg per hole of manure plus 70 kg per hectare of N + P2O5 + K2O. This resulted in the highest yield per Sacha Inchi tree, reaching 173.53 and 176.67 grams per tree respectively. However, a denser planting of 5,555 trees per hectare with the same fertilizer dosage resulted in the highest yield for the first fruit crop and the first year's yield. In Củ Chi, the yield of the first fruit crop was 521.67 kg per hectare, and the first year's yield was 1.41 tons per hectare.

"""What are the nutritional values and benefits of growing Sacha Inchi in Vietnam according to the report?"""	Sacha Inchi is a long-term crop with a quick harvest time and high seasonality. Its cultivation, harvesting, preservation, and processing techniques are relatively simple. The Sacha Inchi seeds are highly nutritious, with an oil content of 41.4% and protein content of 24.7%. The fatty acid composition in Sacha Inchi oil includes a-linolenic (50.8%) and linoleic (33.4%), with the majority being unsaturated fatty acids (97.2%), and lesser amounts of free fatty acids (1.2%), and phospholipids (0.8%). The seeds are also rich in iodine, vitamin A, and vitamin E, and are the richest in omega 3 among plants. However, the current yield of Sacha Inchi seeds in Vietnam is relatively low. Studies have been conducted on cultivation methods to increase yield. For instance, planting Sacha Inchi at densities of 3,333 plants/ha with a certain level of fertilization resulted in the highest yield per plant in both Cu Chi and Cam My. However, a denser planting of 5,555 plants/ha with the same level of fertilization resulted in the highest yield for the first fruiting season and the first year.

What are the major threats to agriculture in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam due to climate change, and what are some of the most common agricultural adaptation strategies used to combat these issues?	Climate change poses significant threats to agriculture in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, particularly to rice production. One of the major threats is the increase in salinity levels, which can reach a threshold that makes conditions unsuitable for rice production. This could put about 40% of the total rice harvest at high risk. Climate change is also expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise, which could lead to an increase in salinity in freshwater, also pose a significant threat. This could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.As for adaptation strategies, the context does not provide specific measures used in the Mekong Delta. However, it mentions that there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation possible due to the complexity and multifaceted nature of climate change, sea level rise, and salt intrusion. Therefore, addressing these problems would require a variety of strategies on different scales.

What were the impacts of the 2015/2016 El Niño event on rice production and water salinity levels in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	The 2015/2016 El Niño event had severe impacts on rice production and water salinity levels in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam. This event was classified as one of the most severe droughts in the past 90 years in south Vietnam, leading to a decline in water discharge in the upstream part of the Mekong River Delta. Salinity levels in the lower part of the deltas increased due to saltwater intrusion. Salinity levels of more than 4 g/L were found in the river water up to 90 km distance from the coast. Eleven out of thirteen provinces and around 225,000 ha of rice land in the Mekong River Delta were adversely affected, resulting in high economic losses.

Based on the context provided, what are the main crops grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and what are the major challenges faced, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and water management?	The main crop grown in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam is rice, with an annual production of 25 million tons on 4.25 million hectares. This region contributes to over 50% of the national rice export. However, the Mekong Delta faces significant challenges, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and water management. Salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m pose unsuitable conditions for rice production, putting about 40% of the total rice harvest at high risk. Climate change is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise, which range between 14-31 cm, indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations.

What are the potential threats to food security in the Mekong River delta in Vietnam due to salinity intrusion and inadequate water management as a result of climate change?	The potential threats to food security in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam due to salinity intrusion and inadequate water management as a result of climate change include a significant risk to rice production. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. Groundwater, an important source for municipal and industrial water demands, is also affected by climate change, which is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, particularly reducing it during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This scenario jeopardizes around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

Kundzewicz et al., 2007).In the following, threats specifically referring to the individual \ndeltas are described:\n3.1\u2003 |\u2003Ganges –Brahmaputra Delta\nThe delta plain of the Ganges–Brahmaputra is prone to floods and according to the (FAO, 2011), “each year about 18 percent of Bangladesh is inundated during the monsoon season.” In a study, Mirza, Warrick, and Ericksen (2003) estimated the average area under flooding as 30% with a maximum of 70% during extreme floods.During the dry season, water scarcity and salinity are major con -\ncerns to agriculture.A reduced freshwater flow enables sea water, pushed by strong tidal forces, to intrude up to 200 km towards the inland (Dasgupta et al., 2014).With the onset of the pre-monsoon (late April), salinity levels in river decrease and finally drop with the onset of the monsoon end of May.Coastal areas are particularly at risk, with nearly 0.8 million ha or \n53% of the total area being affected by salinity (FAO, 2002; Minar, Hossain, & Shamsuddin, 2013).Assuming an average yield of 4.3 t/ha,\n1 salinity in this particular area jeopardizes 3.4 million tons of rice \nor 7% of the national rice production.According to the Soil Science Development Institute (SRDI) of Bangladesh, reported in Rabbani, Munira, and Saif (2018), over 50% of the agricultural land of \nBangladesh is degraded by saline water.In addition, the rate of salt -\nwater intrusion is increasing with an average increase of 0.74% and a total expansion by 1.06 million ha from 1973 to 2009 (SRDI (2010) in Jabed, Paul, and Nath, (2018)).As a consequence of uncontrolled groundwater abstraction \nand overexploitation, water pollution including saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, lowering of groundwater table depths, decreased flows of rivers during the dry season and possible land subsidence was described (FAO, 2011).High relative sea level rise was reported for coastal areas in \nthe Ganges–Brahmaputra delta as over 20 mm per year (Ericson, \nVörösmarty, Dingman, Ward, & Meybeck,  2006).Similar findings \nwere reported by Singh et al.2000, reported in Baten, Seal, and Lisa (2015)), stating a relative sea level rise of 4.0–7.8 mm/year in three different locations in coastal Bangladesh.Dasgupta et al.(2014) investigated current and future river salin -\nity for the southwest region of Bangladesh, using different emission and relative sea level rise scenarios (RMSL) (Table 3).Even under the best-case scenario (B1 and 35 cm RMSL), the \nresults indicate that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh by 2050.The authors further estimated a decrease by 11.1% and 29.7% of area suitable for agriculture in the best case and worst-case (A2 and 67 cm RMSL) scenario, respectively.3.2\u2003|\u2003Mekong River Delta\nLow annual floods during rainy season inundate up to 35% of the area (Tuan et al., ;

"""What are the main crops grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and what challenges does it face due to tropical monsoon climate and salinity intrusion according to the report?"""	The main crop grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam is rice, with an annual production of 25 million tons on 4.25 million hectares of harvested area. This region contributes to over 50% of the national rice export. However, the Mekong Delta faces challenges due to its tropical monsoon climate and salinity intrusion. The climate is characterized by a distinct rainy season from June to November, with over 80% of the precipitation occurring during this period, often resulting in seasonal floods. The hydrological infrastructure of the Mekong River Delta has been greatly altered by human activity, which may exacerbate these challenges. Additionally, the report mentions the issue of salinity intrusion, but does not provide specific details on how this impacts the Mekong Delta's rice production.

Based on the context, how does the seasonal variation in the Mekong River's flow rates contribute to saltwater intrusion and water scarcity in the Mekong Delta during the dry season?	During the rainy season from June to November, the Mekong River's discharge is 25-30 times higher compared to the dry season. However, during the dry season from December to April, the river's flow rates drop to around 6% of the rates during the monsoon season. This reduction in flow rates leads to seasonal water scarcity for up to 1.5 million hectares of irrigated land. Additionally, groundwater levels drop by 2-3 meters during the dry season, which allows sea water to intrude into surface and groundwater resources, further exacerbating the seasonal water scarcity.

What is the impact of salinity intrusion on rice production in delta areas and how does it relate to sea level rise due to global warming?	Salinity intrusion, which is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers, can have a significant impact on rice production in delta areas. This is because the intrusion of saline water can reduce the amount of available freshwater for irrigation, which is crucial for rice cultivation. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, for example, salinity affects nearly 0.8 million hectares or 53% of the total area, jeopardizing 3.4 million tons of rice or 7% of the national rice production. Similarly, in the Mekong River Delta, about 40% of the total rice harvest is at high risk if salinity levels reach a certain threshold.The issue of salinity intrusion is closely related to sea level rise due to global warming. Rising sea levels can accelerate the intrusion of sea water into freshwater aquifers, exacerbating the problem of salinity. For instance, in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, high relative sea level rise has been reported, and this is expected to cause significant changes in river salinity by 2050, even under the best-case scenario. In the Mekong River Delta, projections for sea level rise indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, which could jeopardize around 30,000 hectares of rice land. Therefore, the impact of salinity intrusion on rice production in delta areas is significant and is expected to worsen with sea level rise due to global warming.

Based on the report, how does salinity intrusion during the dry season affect agricultural production in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	Salinity intrusion during the dry season in the Mekong River Delta poses a persistent threat to agricultural production. Tidal fluctuations push saline intrusion 40–80 km towards inland, reducing water quality. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, or about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta, are at high risk. Climate change is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. Under this scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land are jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes.	['| \u2003497\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nto sustain protective barriers.Deep penetration of saline waters in \nthe delta plain leads to rapid delta fringe expansion in those cases.” Moreover, relative sea level rise, which includes the subsidence of deltas, is accelerating sea water intrusion.Main consequences for deltas are seen in the inundation and loss of land area, and conse -\nquently, the loss of coastal environments with important ecosystems and ecosystem functions.Salinity intrusion in ground- and surface water will increase in intensity and extent, and thus, reduce the amount of available freshwater for irrigation (Jiménez et al., 2014; Kundzewicz et al., 2007).In the following, threats specifically referring to the individual \ndeltas are described:\n3.1\u2003 |\u2003Ganges –Brahmaputra Delta\nThe delta plain of the Ganges–Brahmaputra is prone to floods and according to the (FAO, 2011), “each year about 18 percent of Bangladesh is inundated during the monsoon season.” In a study, Mirza, Warrick, and Ericksen (2003) estimated the average area under flooding as 30% with a maximum of 70% during extreme floods.During the dry season, water scarcity and salinity are major con -\ncerns to agriculture.A reduced freshwater flow enables sea water, pushed by strong tidal forces, to intrude up to 200 km towards the inland (Dasgupta et al., 2014).With the onset of the pre-monsoon (late April), salinity levels in river decrease and finally drop with the onset of the monsoon end of May.Coastal areas are particularly at risk, with nearly 0.8 million ha or \n53% of the total area being affected by salinity (FAO, 2002; Minar, Hossain, & Shamsuddin, 2013).Assuming an average yield of 4.3 t/ha,\n1 salinity in this particular area jeopardizes 3.4 million tons of rice \nor 7% of the national rice production.According to the Soil Science Development Institute (SRDI) of Bangladesh, reported in Rabbani, Munira, and Saif (2018), over 50% of the agricultural land of \nBangladesh is degraded by saline water.In addition, the rate of salt -\nwater intrusion is increasing with an average increase of 0.74% and a total expansion by 1.06 million ha from 1973 to 2009 (SRDI (2010) in Jabed, Paul, and Nath, (2018)).As a consequence of uncontrolled groundwater abstraction \nand overexploitation, water pollution including saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, lowering of groundwater table depths, decreased flows of rivers during the dry season and possible land subsidence was described (FAO, 2011).High relative sea level rise was reported for coastal areas in \nthe Ganges–Brahmaputra delta as over 20 mm per year (Ericson, \nVörösmarty, Dingman, Ward, & Meybeck,  2006).Similar findings \nwere reported by Singh et al.2000, reported in Baten, Seal, and Lisa (2015)), stating a relative sea level rise of 4.0–7.8 mm/year in three different locations in coastal Bangladesh.Dasgupta et al.(2014) investigated current and future river salin -\nity for the southwest region of Bangladesh, using different emission and relative sea level rise scenarios (RMSL) (Table 3).Even under the best-case scenario (B1 and 35 cm RMSL), the \nresults indicate that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh by 2050.The authors further estimated a decrease by 11.1% and 29.7% of area suitable for agriculture in the best case and worst-case (A2 and 67 cm RMSL) scenario, respectively.3.2\u2003|\u2003Mekong River Delta\nLow annual floods during rainy season inundate up to 35% of the area (Tuan et al., ;

What are some of the agronomic interventions and water management strategies that can be used to cope with changing environments and mitigate soil salinity in rice fields, as mentioned in the report?	Agronomic interventions include the selection of appropriate rice varieties for the specific environment. For instance, replacing salinity-sensitive rice varieties with salinity-tolerant ones can help maintain rice production in environments with soil salinity levels up to 3‰. Further research and breeding for salt- and drought-tolerant varieties with improved yields is also important. Another adaptation option at the farm level is to shift to climate- and environment-adapted cropping cycles with adapted varieties. For example, in areas prone to prolonged tidal flooding, farmers can choose traditional varieties due to their higher level of salt tolerance. The method of crop establishment can also influence yield in salt-affected areas. For instance, farmers can adapt transplanting as a crop establishment method to better control the water quality in the nursery field than on the field after sowing.Water management is another effective measure to mitigate soil salinity. Environmental and management factors determine the contribution of groundwater in the form of capillary rise to the root-zone. Water-saving technologies can reduce water requirements on the field and enhance system-scale water availability by shifting the water management scheme from a permanently flooded to a periodically flooded system. However, the choice of the appropriate irrigation technique requires careful assessment as it can be a fine line between saving water and maintaining low salinity soil levels. Water-saving technologies, such as AWD, also have the potential to reduce methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.

What are the potential long-term impacts of shrimp farming on soil salinity in the Mekong Delta, and how might this affect the sustainability of rice-shrimp rotational systems in the context of climate change?	Shrimp farming, particularly in semi-coastal areas, can lead to soil salinization, which is identified as one of the major long-term impacts of shrimp culture. This increase in soil salinity can be exacerbated by the intensification and expansion of rice-shrimp cultivation. In the context of climate change, the sustainability of rice-shrimp rotational systems becomes questionable. This is because these systems lead to a loss of highly valuable freshwater early in the season, which is needed to remove the salt from the system. As a result, farmers become dependent on the intensity of the remaining precipitation. Furthermore, the expected shift in precipitation patterns due to climate change could potentially exacerbate this issue.	['(2015) recommended a shift in agricultural produc -\ntion, mainly towards rice-aquaculture or rice-upland crop rotation for 180,000 ha in order to adapt to a 30 cm sea level rise.In rice-shrimp systems, rice is grown during monsoon season alternately shrimp in the dry season under higher salinity levels (5–40 ppt  \n(FAO, 1986).In an ideal world, the onset of the monsoon drains the field from salt and enables field preparation and rice transplanting.Indeed, shrimp farming was highly promoted to farmers in semi-coastal areas in recent years and farmers practising shrimp-rice rotational systems had on average 50% higher income than farm -\ners practising two rice crops (Anh, Kroeze, Bush, & Mol, 2010; Hossain & Hasan, 2017; Smajgl et al., 2015).In view of climate change and an expected shift of precipitation patterns, however, this system leads to a loss of highly valuable freshwater early in the season, because it is needed to remove the salt from the sys -\ntem (Christensen et al., 2013).As a consequence, farmers depend on the intensity of the remaining precipitation rendering the sus -\ntainability of this system questionable.In addition to effluents loaded with environmentally critical substances, soil salinization has been identified as one of the major long-terms impacts of shrimp culture (Ali, 2006; Anh et al., 2010; Chowdhury, Khairun, Salequzzaman, & Rahman,  2011; Clarke et  al., 2015).Therefore, \nintensification and expansion of rice-shrimp cultivation can lead to an increase in salinity-affected areas.Although the beneficial po-tential of diversified production is recognized, spatial-explicit suit -\nability as well as large scale and long-term impacts need to be assessed.Integrated water resource models describe hydrological \n\u200a3Parts per thousand.1439037x, 2020, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jac.12415 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [10/08/2023].See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use;

Ha et al., 2015).Climate \nchange is going to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons (Bui, Nguyen, Bui, Le, & Le, 2017).Projections for sea level rise are ranging between 14-31 cm \n(MONRE, 2016, cited in in Vu et al.(2018)), and simulated under the RCP 6.0 emission scenario as 25-30cm (Vu et al., 2018).The results from Vu et al.(2018) indicate a shift of the brackish water front (<4 g/L) further inland (50–60 km).Locations with a proximity of 15–20 km to the coast are estimated to have an increase of salinity in freshwater by 0.5–2.5 g/L and locations with a distance of 30 km are estimated to have an increase of 1–1.5 g/L.Under this scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land are jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes.Also Wassmann et al., (2004) concluded that around 60% of the Mekong River Delta (2.3 million ha) are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.3.3\u2003|\u2003Ayeyarwady Delta\nFlood, droughts and salinity intrusion are substantial threats for the delta with an increasing trend over the last decades (MCCA, 2019; Taft & Evers, 2016).3.7% (about 56,000 ha) of the rice-growing area in the delta are affected by salinity (Swe & Ando, 2016).Starting with the end of monsoon in November sea water in -\ntrudes into the mainland up to 100 km from the coastline and then gradually decreases with onset of the monsoon (Swe & Ando, 2016; Taft & Evers, 2016).Rising sea level increase soil salinity levels and consequently lead to a loss of arable land in the coastal area (Seinn Seinn, Ahman, Thapa, & Shresta, 2015).As summarized by Oo, Huylenbroeck, and Speelman (2018), salt intrusion poses a year-round threat on coastal areas of Myanmar and thus, is classified as a major threat for agriculture.As development of water dams and hydropower upstream of the \ndelta continues, the amount of sediments reaching the delta will de -\ncrease and erosion will accelerate in coastal land at the river mouth.Currently, no hydropower dams are installed yet at the Ayeyarwady River, but many are in the planning stage (Taft & Evers, 2016).So far, scientific and peer-reviewed research on impacts of an -\nthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations on the water resources in Ayeyarwady delta are lacking, but are extremely ur -\ngent for planning future water allocation and management (Taft & Evers,  2016).4\u2003| \u2003ADAPTATION OPTIONS\nIt is widely recognized that climate change poses a threat to both, people and environment at different levels.In AMDs, the impacts of global change pose a threat to agricultural production, food security, livelihood and national economies.However, climate change, and also sea level rise and salt intrusion are complex and multifaceted problems.Therefore, there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation possible, but there are many ways to address the problem on different scales.']
What are the potential impacts of alterations in freshwater availability and seawater intrusion induced by climate change on rice production in the Mekong Delta, according to Schneider and Asch's 2020 report?	Alterations in freshwater availability and seawater intrusion induced by climate change could have significant impacts on rice production in the Mekong Delta. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta, or about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, are at high risk. Groundwater, an important source for municipal and industrial water demands, is expected to be substantially altered by climate change, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise are ranging between 14-31 cm, and this could shift the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This scenario could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.	['| \u2003503\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nThanh, N. C.

What are the current issues of groundwater in the Mekong River Basin and how does salinity intrusion affect rice production in this region?	Groundwater in the Mekong River Delta is an important source for municipal and industrial water demands. The delta has eight groundwater aquifers at different depths, with levels and salt concentrations varying depending on the season and distance to the coast. Climate change is expected to significantly alter groundwater recharge, particularly causing a high reduction during dry seasons. Salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m pose unsuitable conditions for rice production. Under such conditions, about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, or about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta, are at high risk. Projections for sea level rise, which could increase salinity in freshwater, indicate that around 30,000 ha of rice land could be jeopardized, with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

Kundzewicz et al., 2007).In the following, threats specifically referring to the individual \ndeltas are described:\n3.1\u2003 |\u2003Ganges –Brahmaputra Delta\nThe delta plain of the Ganges–Brahmaputra is prone to floods and according to the (FAO, 2011), “each year about 18 percent of Bangladesh is inundated during the monsoon season.” In a study, Mirza, Warrick, and Ericksen (2003) estimated the average area under flooding as 30% with a maximum of 70% during extreme floods.During the dry season, water scarcity and salinity are major con -\ncerns to agriculture.A reduced freshwater flow enables sea water, pushed by strong tidal forces, to intrude up to 200 km towards the inland (Dasgupta et al., 2014).With the onset of the pre-monsoon (late April), salinity levels in river decrease and finally drop with the onset of the monsoon end of May.Coastal areas are particularly at risk, with nearly 0.8 million ha or \n53% of the total area being affected by salinity (FAO, 2002; Minar, Hossain, & Shamsuddin, 2013).Assuming an average yield of 4.3 t/ha,\n1 salinity in this particular area jeopardizes 3.4 million tons of rice \nor 7% of the national rice production.According to the Soil Science Development Institute (SRDI) of Bangladesh, reported in Rabbani, Munira, and Saif (2018), over 50% of the agricultural land of \nBangladesh is degraded by saline water.In addition, the rate of salt -\nwater intrusion is increasing with an average increase of 0.74% and a total expansion by 1.06 million ha from 1973 to 2009 (SRDI (2010) in Jabed, Paul, and Nath, (2018)).As a consequence of uncontrolled groundwater abstraction \nand overexploitation, water pollution including saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, lowering of groundwater table depths, decreased flows of rivers during the dry season and possible land subsidence was described (FAO, 2011).High relative sea level rise was reported for coastal areas in \nthe Ganges–Brahmaputra delta as over 20 mm per year (Ericson, \nVörösmarty, Dingman, Ward, & Meybeck,  2006).Similar findings \nwere reported by Singh et al.2000, reported in Baten, Seal, and Lisa (2015)), stating a relative sea level rise of 4.0–7.8 mm/year in three different locations in coastal Bangladesh.Dasgupta et al.(2014) investigated current and future river salin -\nity for the southwest region of Bangladesh, using different emission and relative sea level rise scenarios (RMSL) (Table 3).Even under the best-case scenario (B1 and 35 cm RMSL), the \nresults indicate that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh by 2050.The authors further estimated a decrease by 11.1% and 29.7% of area suitable for agriculture in the best case and worst-case (A2 and 67 cm RMSL) scenario, respectively.3.2\u2003|\u2003Mekong River Delta\nLow annual floods during rainy season inundate up to 35% of the area (Tuan et al., ; Tuan et al., 2007).Salinity is a persistent threat for \nagricultural production during the dry season.Tidal fluctuations push saline intrusion 40–80 km towards inland, and thus reduce water quality (SIWRR, 2010, reported in Tri, 2012; Vu, Yamada, & Ishidaira, 2018)).The extent of salinity intrusion is associated with rainfall, upstream water discharge, and tidal pressure (CGIAR, 2016; Dasgupta et al., 2014).']
Based on the provided context, what are some of the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater resources and rice production in the Mekong Delta?	Climate change is expected to significantly alter groundwater recharge in the Mekong River Delta, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland by 50–60 km. This could increase salinity in freshwater by 0.5–2.5 g/L in locations 15–20 km from the coast and by 1–1.5 g/L in locations 30 km from the coast. Under this scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land could be jeopardized, with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes.

What are the potential impacts of floods, salinity, and climate change on rice production in the Mekong River Delta, as discussed in the context?	The potential impacts of floods, salinity, and climate change on rice production in the Mekong River Delta include a significant risk to the rice harvest due to increased salinity levels. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. Climate change is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise, which range between 14-31 cm, indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This scenario could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

"""What are the potential impacts of coastal salinity on rice production as discussed in the case study of Pyapon Township, Ayeyarwady Region in Myanmar, and how might these impacts be relevant to my rice farming in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?"""	The context does not provide a specific case study on Pyapon Township, Ayeyarwady Region in Myanmar. However, it does discuss the general impacts of coastal salinity on rice production in the Ayeyarwady Delta and the Mekong Delta. In both regions, salinity intrusion is a significant threat, particularly with the increasing trend of climate change. In the Ayeyarwady Delta, salinity intrusion poses a year-round threat to coastal areas, affecting about 3.7% of the rice-growing area. Rising sea levels increase soil salinity levels, leading to a loss of arable land in the coastal area. This is a major threat to agriculture in the region. In the Mekong Delta, if salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which is unsuitable for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest is at high risk. Climate change is expected to alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This scenario jeopardizes around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. These impacts could be relevant to your rice farming in the Mekong Delta as they highlight the potential risks associated with increased salinity due to climate change and sea level rise. It underscores the need for adaptation strategies to mitigate these risks.

 \nTuan et al., 2007).2.1.3\u2003 |\u2003Ayeyarwady Delta\nThe Ayeryawady Delta in Myanmar covers an area of about 2 million ha and accounts for about 3% of Myanmars total area.It is character -\nized by a tropical monsoon climate with distinct rainy and dry sea -\nsons (Table 2).The delta is one of the most important rice-growing areas of the country as more than 50% of the total arable land is used for rice cultivation (Coleman et al., 2003; GRiSP, 2013; MOAI, 2015; Naing, Kingsbury, Buerkert, & Finckh, 2008).Myanmar is the sixth largest rice producer in the world, achieving \nan annual rice production of 26 million tons (GRiSP, 2013).Rice production is sustaining food security and plays a key role in \nincome generation and employment.82% of Myanmar's population is employed in agriculture (MOAI,  2015).More than 60% of the rice comes from rainfed production during \nmonsoon season (Figure 2), and only about 20% comes from irri -\ngated systems (FAO, 2002).The green revolution and expansion or improvement of irriga -\ntion infrastructure led to a shift in the use of cultivated varieties, use of fertilizers and crop rotations (Naing et al., 2008).However, the \nirrigation infrastructure is still poorly developed.According to the FAO (2012), Myanmar's total irrigation area increased from 1995 (1.5 million ha) to 2004 (2.1 million ha) by about 7% annually.All irrigation water comes from surface water (FAO, 2012).The Ayeyarwady is the country's most important river system, \nwith high variations in river discharge.As stated in Taft and Evers (2016), nearly two-thirds of the annual river discharge occur during rainy season, with the lowest rates in the dry season from February to March (Driel & Nauta, 2015).The river network is influenced by diurnal tides, and saltwater is entering deep into the delta (Driel & Nauta, 2015).The river system is natural and less man-modified as compared to the river networks of Ganges–Brahmaputra delta and Mekong River Delta.Only a few sluice gates were built in the lower delta to prevent the intrusion of saltwater (Driel & Nauta, 2015).As indicated by Taft and Evers (2016), research and information \non the Ayeyarwady river basin are lacking, in particular on current and future impacts of climate change and human interventions on water resources.3\u2003| \u2003THREATS\nAccording to the fifth assessment report of the IPCC, AMDs are ranked among the regions being most vulnerable to impacts of cli -\nmate change, which is mainly due to their specific geographic setting and low elevation (Clarke et al., 2015; Cruz et al., 2007).Global climate change and an increase of interventions in natural \nstreamflow interrupt the natural balance of fresh- and saltwater, as well as sedimentation load.Thus, freshwater scarcity and erosion are major threats for tidal influenced deltas.""]"
What are the potential impacts of sea level rise due to climate change on seawater intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and how might this affect rice production?	Sea level rise due to climate change is projected to significantly alter the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. It's expected to increase the salinity levels in the groundwater, especially during dry seasons. This is particularly concerning as salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m can create unsuitable conditions for rice production. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, and under certain emission scenarios, this could lead to a shift of the brackish water front further inland. Locations close to the coast could see an increase in salinity in freshwater, which could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land and lead to an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons. This could put a significant portion of the total rice harvest at high risk.	['498\u2003 |\u2003 \u2003\u2002\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nAssuming that salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, and thus \npose unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, or about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta, are at high risk.2\nGroundwater is an important source for municipal and indus -\ntrial water demands.The Mekong River Delta has eight groundwa -\nter aquifers in different depths ranging from very shallow by up to 400 m (Ha, Ngoc, Lee, & Jayakumar, 2015).Groundwater levels as well as their salt concentration differ depending on season and dis -\ntance to the coast (Buschmann et al., 2008; Ha et al., 2015).Climate \nchange is going to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons (Bui, Nguyen, Bui, Le, & Le, 2017).Projections for sea level rise are ranging between 14-31 cm \n(MONRE, 2016, cited in in Vu et al.(2018)), and simulated under the RCP 6.0 emission scenario as 25-30cm (Vu et al., 2018).The results from Vu et al.(2018) indicate a shift of the brackish water front (<4 g/L) further inland (50–60 km).Locations with a proximity of 15–20 km to the coast are estimated to have an increase of salinity in freshwater by 0.5–2.5 g/L and locations with a distance of 30 km are estimated to have an increase of 1–1.5 g/L.Under this scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land are jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes.Also Wassmann et al., (2004) concluded that around 60% of the Mekong River Delta (2.3 million ha) are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.3.3\u2003|\u2003Ayeyarwady Delta\nFlood, droughts and salinity intrusion are substantial threats for the delta with an increasing trend over the last decades (MCCA, 2019; Taft & Evers, 2016).3.7% (about 56,000 ha) of the rice-growing area in the delta are affected by salinity (Swe & Ando, 2016).Starting with the end of monsoon in November sea water in -\ntrudes into the mainland up to 100 km from the coastline and then gradually decreases with onset of the monsoon (Swe & Ando, 2016; Taft & Evers, 2016).Rising sea level increase soil salinity levels and consequently lead to a loss of arable land in the coastal area (Seinn Seinn, Ahman, Thapa, & Shresta, 2015).As summarized by Oo, Huylenbroeck, and Speelman (2018), salt intrusion poses a year-round threat on coastal areas of Myanmar and thus, is classified as a major threat for agriculture.As development of water dams and hydropower upstream of the \ndelta continues, the amount of sediments reaching the delta will de -\ncrease and erosion will accelerate in coastal land at the river mouth.Currently, no hydropower dams are installed yet at the Ayeyarwady River, but many are in the planning stage (Taft & Evers, 2016).So far, scientific and peer-reviewed research on impacts of an -\nthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations on the water resources in Ayeyarwady delta are lacking, but are extremely ur -\ngent for planning future water allocation and management (Taft & Evers,  2016).4\u2003| \u2003ADAPTATION OPTIONS\nIt is widely recognized that climate change poses a threat to both, people and environment at different levels.In AMDs, the impacts of global change pose a threat to agricultural production, food security, livelihood and national economies.However, climate change, and also sea level rise and salt intrusion are complex and multifaceted problems.Therefore, there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation possible, but there are many ways to address the problem on different scales.', '| \u2003503\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nThanh, N.

Based on the report, how do anthropogenic developments and natural hazards interact to increase saltwater intrusion, and how does this impact the quality and production of rice in the Mekong Delta?	Anthropogenic developments such as the construction of high dikes, sand mining, upstream dams, and groundwater extraction can interact with natural hazards to increase saltwater intrusion. High dikes are built to keep out floodwaters and salt intrusion, but they also reduce fertile silt deposits. Sand mining and upstream dams reduce the frequency of natural freshwater flooding and trap sediments in reservoirs upstream, which can affect sediment accumulation. Groundwater extraction can cause land subsidence, which can lead to saltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination. Natural hazards like typhoons and sea level rise can induce saltwater flooding and exacerbate salinity intrusion. Droughts can also worsen the extent of salinity intrusion due to a lack of fresh water. Climate change may further exacerbate these effects by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters.These interactions can have negative impacts on the quality and production of rice in the Mekong Delta. Saltwater intrusion can limit rice production areas and force many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops. The reduction in fertile silt deposits due to high dikes and the reduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams can potentially reduce rice growing areas in the future. Furthermore, arsenic contamination from groundwater extraction can negatively affect the quality of rice produced.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.']
Based on the report, how does the vulnerability of the Mekong River Delta to environmental hazards impact agricultural production in the region?	The vulnerability of the Mekong River Delta to environmental hazards has significant impacts on agricultural production in the region. Natural hazards such as typhoons, floods, and droughts can cause substantial damage to crops, particularly rice, which is a staple food and key export crop for Vietnam. For instance, typhoons can cause damage to rice crops through strong winds and flooding from heavy rain, especially if they occur during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods. Floods, often caused by heavy monsoonal rains, can also damage crops, although moderate levels of freshwater flooding may be beneficial to agricultural production. Droughts, while uncommon, have caused significant economic loss, particularly in the agriculture sector. The 2015-2016 drought, for example, affected all the Mekong River Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 million in damage, with USD 300 million being agriculture- and aquaculture-related damage. In addition to natural hazards, anthropogenic land-use changes also affect agricultural production. Higher prices and rising demand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incentivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to embrace non-rice crops. Environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their now-unusable rice fields into shrimp ponds or turn to growing salt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion has reduced rice growing areas, although agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high despite shrinking growing areas. The construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields, but these high dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Other anthropogenic factors such as sand mining and upstream dam construction, while not directly related to agriculture, can reduce sediment availability and increase channel erosion, which would have adverse implications on agricultural productivity.

Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.']
How has worsening salinity intrusion affected rice production in the Mekong Delta, and what alternative crops are farmers turning to in response to this issue?	Worsening salinity intrusion, particularly during the dry season, has negatively impacted rice production in the Mekong Delta. Approximately 1.8 million hectares in the Mekong River Delta are already affected by dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million hectares are affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1. This area is predicted to increase with rising sea levels. Increased soil salinization leads to a loss of land available for rice production. However, the context does not provide specific information on what alternative crops farmers are turning to in response to this issue.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021']
"""How does the systems-thinking approach help in understanding the interaction between anthropogenic land-use factors and natural hazards, and their influence on rice productivity in the Mekong Delta?"""	The systems-thinking approach provides a comprehensive view of how anthropogenic land-use factors and natural hazards interact and influence rice productivity in the Mekong Delta. It allows for the understanding of the multidimensional and interdependent nature of the issues affecting food security. For instance, it can illustrate how human activities such as dike construction, sand mining, groundwater extraction, and dam construction can impact rice productivity. It also shows how natural hazards like typhoons and sea level rise can exacerbate problems created by human activities, such as inducing saltwater flooding and worsening salinity intrusion. The approach also helps in visualizing how these factors operate at different scales - local, regional, or global. Furthermore, it can highlight potential unanticipated outcomes of interventions aimed at ameliorating these problems.	['On a more technical level,\nChapman and Darby (2016) used system dynamics modeling\nto simulate the delays, feedbacks and tipping points between\nfarmers’ socioeconomic status and the practice of double- or\ntriple-cropping in An Giang Province in the MRD.Building\non the framework provided by these studies, we use systems-\nthinking to present an overarching picture of how anthro-\npogenic and natural-hazard drivers can interact to reinforce\nor diminish rice production.While many studies may have\nhighlighted the links between the various drivers and rice\nproduction, we seek to integrate the different drivers of an-\nthropogenic change and natural hazards to show their inter-\nrelated and interdependent nature and how the processes as-\nsociated with each driver affect rice growing areas, rice pro-\nduction and rice quality in general.The use of systems-thinking is appropriate as the wicked\nenvironmental problems present in the deltas of Vietnam\nare caused by a range of interdependent anthropogenic and\nnatural hazards drivers operating at multiple scales with no\neasily identiﬁable, predeﬁned solutions.While interventions\nmay be made to ameliorate problems, these interventions\nmay create feedbacks and unanticipated outcomes (Rittel\nand Webber, 1973; DeFries and Nagendra, 2017).In addi-\ntion, systems-thinking can be applied in a range of contexts\nand at multiple scales.Geist and Lambin (2002) and Lim et\nal.(2017) applied a system-dynamics approach to understand\ndrivers of deforestation and forest degradation at the national\nand global scales, while Ziegler et al.(2016) used a trans-\ndisciplinary learning approach to understand the role of en-\nvironmental and cultural factors in driving the development\nof human diseases in northeastern Thailand at the landscape\nscale.Our aim is to use a literature review to develop ﬂow dia-\ngrams to represent the major linkages between anthropogenic\nland-use factors and natural hazards and elaborate on how\nthey interact and inﬂuence rice productivity in these two\ndeltas.Due to the importance of Vietnam as a major rice pro-\nducer and exporter in Southeast Asia as well as the range of\nthreats faced by the rice sector from natural hazards and an-\nthropogenic land use, we hope to show how the processes\nand issues affecting food security are not one-dimensional\nand linear but in fact reinforcing and interdependent.Lastly,\ngiven that deltas worldwide are globally signiﬁcant for food\nproduction and are highly stressed and degraded landscapes,\nwe argue that a systems-thinking approach can be applied to\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1487\nland and water pollution and reduces crop quality.In addi-\ntion, anthropogenic developments such as dike construction\ncan improve agricultural productivity but also create unin-\ntended environmental problems.Even human activities that\nare unrelated to agriculture such as sand mining, groundwa-\nter extraction and dam construction can reduce rice produc-\ntivity.In addition, natural hazards not only affect rice quality\nand quantity but may also amplify some of the problems cre-\nated by human activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level\nrise may induce saltwater ﬂooding and worsen salinity intru-\nsion.In the future, climate change may exacerbate the effects\nof natural hazards by increasing the frequency and severity\nof natural disasters.Therefore, the problems associated with\nsome of the natural hazards such as excessive saltwater ﬂood-\ning and saltwater intrusion may increase in frequency and\nseverity.In sum, the processes and issues affecting food se-\ncurity are multidimensional and interdependent, and we used\na systems-thinking approach to develop a visual represen-\ntation of the ways in which anthropogenic land-use factors\nand natural hazards can affect rice quantity and quality in the\nMRD and the RRD in Vietnam.We have also sought to de-\nﬁne whether the anthropogenic or natural-hazard driver was a\nlocal, regional or global driver to highlight the scale at which\neach driver operates.Our review focuses on food security in Vietnam’s two\ndeltas but can be applied to other contexts.The problems\npresent in the two deltas in Vietnam are hardly unique.Across the world, deltas are global food production hubs that\nsupport large populations.Nearly half a billion people live in\ndeltaic regions.Similar to the Mekong and Red River deltas,\nlarge tracts of deltaic wetlands in other countries have been\nreclaimed for agriculture, aquaculture, and urban and indus-\ntrial land use.Resultantly, many deltas suffer from ﬂood-\ning, retreating shorelines due to upstream dams, pollution\nproblems, and increasing land subsidence due to groundwa-\nter and mineral extraction.With climate change, rising sea\nlevels will further threaten the viability of the deltaic land-\nform (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Day et al., 2016; Giosan et al.,\n2014; Syvitski et al., 2009).Given that river deltas worldwide are highly stressed and\ndegraded, a systems-thinking approach can provide a holis-\ntic overview of the “wicked problems” faced in each loca-\ntion and how the various environmental processes interact\nwith each other.Although our study has focused on rice agri-\nculture in the two deltas in Vietnam, the application of a\nsystems-thinking approach to evaluate other pertinent phe-\nnomena in deltas elsewhere is a useful tool for understand-\ning how human activities, natural hazards and climate change\nhave compromised deltaic sustainability.Data availability.The papers used in this study are listed in the\nSupplement.Supplement.The supplement related to this article is available on-\nline at: https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021-supplement.Author contributions.KW and JSH came up with the idea for this\nproject.KW reviewed papers and wrote the manuscript with dis-\ncussions and improvements from all co-authors.JSH, AD, PT, TTH\nand VDQ provided feedback on the analysis of data and helped in\nrevisions of the manuscript.JSH provided ﬁnancial support for this\npaper.Competing interests.The authors declare that they have no conﬂict\nof interest.Acknowledgements.We thank Khoi Dang Kim, Jose Ma Luis Pan-\ngalangan Montesclaros and Nghiem Thi Phuong Le for their advice.We greatly appreciate the constructive comments and detailed feed-\nback by our reviewers.Financial support.This research has been supported by the Earth\nObservatory of Singapore (grant no.M4430263.B50.706022) via\nits funding from the National Research Foundation Singapore and\nthe Singapore Ministry of Education under the Research Centres of\nExcellence initiative.This work comprises EOS contribution num-\nber 360.\nReview statement.']
"""What are the dominant types of soil in the Mekong River Delta and how might their characteristics affect the impact of salinity intrusion on rice agriculture?"""	The Mekong River Delta is dominated by alluvial, acid sulfate, and saline soils. Most of the rice in this region grows in the highly fertile alluvial soils, which are found in only 30% of the delta. The characteristics of these soils, particularly their fertility, can influence how they are affected by salinity intrusion. For instance, saline soils already have high salt content, and additional salinity intrusion could further increase this, potentially affecting the growth and productivity of rice. Acid sulfate soils, on the other hand, could react differently to salinity intrusion. However, the specific impacts would depend on various factors, including the extent of the intrusion and local geogenic conditions.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', 'K.

"""How many rice crops are produced annually in the Mekong River Delta and what are their respective production volumes?"""	In the Mekong River Delta, three rice crops are produced annually. In 2018, the spring, autumn, and winter paddies covered areas of 1.6 million ha, 2.3 million ha, and 197.2 thousand ha respectively.

The ref-\nerences we used are found in the Supplement.\n3 Results\n3.1 Local anthropogenic drivers\n3.1.1 Aquaculture and alternative crops\nBoth deltas face widespread salinity intrusion that threatens\nrice production. In the Mekong River Delta, salinity intrusion\nis a naturally occurring phenomenon during the dry season.\nTides from the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand\nbring saltwater inland, and salinity intrudes up to 70–90 km\ninland as the length of sea dikes is limited. There are 1500 km\nof sea and estuary dikes in RRD versus 450 km of sea dikes\nin the MRD (Le et al., 2018; Preston et al., 2003; Pilarcyzk\nand Nguyen, 2005). Thus, salinity intrusion extends up to20 km from the main river in the RRD (Ca et al., 1994). As\nrice plants are unable to thrive in soils with soil salinities ex-\nceeding 4 g L−1(V . H. T. Pham et al., 2018), affected farmers\nhave converted their paddy ﬁelds into aquaculture ponds to\ncultivate shrimp and ﬁsh instead. Other farmers have turned\nto planting salinity-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango\nand sugarcane. In some cases, farmers have opted for a rice-\naquaculture system, whereby rice is planted in the wet sea-\nson, and ﬁsh and shrimp are cultivated in the dry season,\nwhen soil salinities are high (Nguyen and V o, 2017; Pham\net al., 2017).\nBesides environmental factors, the greater proﬁtability of\nfruits, vegetables, ﬁsh and shrimp also incentivizes farmers\nto plant more non-rice crops. The income per hectare of\nrice was USD 146 compared to pomelo (USD 16 844) and\ncoconut (USD 1484) (Hoang and Tran, 2019). Meanwhile,\nfarmers who practice shrimp–rice rotational systems earned\n50 % more than those who had two rice crops (Morton, 2020;\nSchneider and Asch, 2020). In addition, high demand for\nfruits and vegetables for export and from growing urban pop-\nulations with greater afﬂuence and knowledge about nutrition\nalso encouraged farmers to diversify from rice monoculture,\nleading to possible declines in the overall rice growing area\n(Hai, 2021; Nguyen and V o, 2017; Fig. 4).\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.

"""How does the increase or decrease in anthropogenic drivers influence rice productivity in the Mekong Delta, according to the report?"""	The report indicates that anthropogenic drivers can have both positive and negative effects on rice productivity in the Mekong Delta. For instance, the construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields. However, these high dikes also reduce the availability of fertile silt, forcing farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Urban expansion is another key factor that has reduced rice growing areas, although agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high despite shrinking growing areas. Additionally, environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their now-unusable rice fields into shrimp ponds or turn to growing salt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Furthermore, government policies encouraging farmers to move away from growing rice have contributed to the planting of more non-rice crops on paddy land, leading to increased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards, and aquaculture. Despite moving away from rice cultivation, many farmers continue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops, which can lead to pesticide resistance and potentially increase outbreaks of pests and diseases. Lastly, the report mentions that anthropogenic factors like sand mining and upstream dam construction, which reduce sediment availability and increase channel erosion, could have adverse implications on agricultural productivity, even though these factors are often not directly linked to agricultural productivity.

Flow diagram showing the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. The drivers\nare classiﬁed as a local driver if it occurs in the two mega-deltas. Regional drivers are those that occur farther away from the two mega-deltas\nbut within the Asian region. A plus ( +) sign indicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to increase (decrease). A negative ( −) sign\nindicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to decrease (increase). Dashed lines with “ ±” are used when outcomes are unclear. For\nexample, dikes reduce ﬂooding, but poorly maintained or planned dikes increase ﬂooding instead. In addition, dikes may potentially cause\nﬂooding in unprotected areas. Agrochemical use may reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but the overuse of chemicals can lead to\npesticide resistance, which may increase outbreaks of pests and diseases.\nFinally, government policies encouraging farmers to move\naway from growing rice also contributed to the planting of\nmore non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is\nincreased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards,\nand freshwater and brackish aquaculture (Van Kien et al.,\n2020). Using remote sensing to assess land-use and land-\ncover change in the Mekong River Delta, Liu et al. (2020)\nfound that aquaculture had become the second-largest land-\nuse type, following planted land. This was facilitated by gov-\nernment regulations, salt intrusion and higher proﬁtability\nof aquaculture productions. In any case, even though farm-\ners may have moved on from growing rice, many still con-\ntinue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops\n(Normile, 2013; Fig. 4).\n3.1.2 Urban expansion\nRapid urbanization is accelerating the loss of agricultural\nland in both the Red River Delta and Mekong River Delta. In\nHanoi, a major city in the Red River Delta, 1420 ha of agri-cultural land was lost per year from 2000–2007, equivalent to\na yearly loss of 3 %. By 2025, up to 450 000 ha of agricultural\nland is expected to be converted to urban land. Most of this\nland-use conversion occurs in peri-urban areas 5–15 km from\nthe city center. The same peri-urban land is often used to\ngrow food, ﬂowers and livestock for the urban population in\nHanoi. However, this land is considered by local authorities\nto be land reserve for urban planning instead of resources for\nfood supply (Drebold, 2017; Pham et al., 2015). Most of this\nperi-urban agricultural land is often forcibly obtained, with\nminimal compensation given to farmers, and then sold to for-\neign developers (Drebold, 2017). Similar urban expansion is\nalso occurring in Can Tho city in the Mekong River Delta,\nwith corresponding losses of agricultural land (cf. Garscha-\ngen et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2010). A decline in agricultural\nland means a decline in rice growing areas as well (Fig. 4).\nHigh land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land\nhave forced farmers to practice agricultural intensiﬁcation. In\nthe RRD, rice production grew more than 25 % from 2000–\n2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M.

Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.']
"""What are the effects of salinity intrusion on rice farming in the Mekong Delta and how have farmers adapted to this issue?"""	Salinity intrusion can have significant impacts on rice farming in the Mekong Delta. It can lead to a reduction in rice growing areas and negatively affect the quality of rice produced. The severity of salinity intrusion can be exacerbated by natural hazards such as typhoons, sea level rise, and droughts. Farmers in the Mekong Delta have adapted to saline intrusion through various means. However, the specific strategies they employ are not detailed in the provided context.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', 'Pham, V .H.

"""What are the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the Mekong Delta, and how does the government's encouragement to move away from rice farming contribute to the increased use of paddy land for non-rice crops and aquaculture?"""	The key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the Mekong Delta include land-use change, urban expansion, and government policies. Land-use change involves farmers shifting from rice monoculture to non-rice crops and aquaculture due to higher prices and rising demand for these products. Environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have also forced many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops like coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion, particularly in major cities like Can Tho, is leading to the loss of agricultural land, which in turn reduces rice growing areas. Government policies have also played a significant role. The government has been encouraging farmers to move away from growing rice, which has contributed to the planting of more non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is increased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards, and freshwater and brackish aquaculture. This shift was facilitated by government regulations, salt intrusion, and the higher profitability of aquaculture productions. Despite moving away from rice, many farmers continue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops.	['1478 K. W.

T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.']
"""How does the annual deposition of sediment-bound nutrients from floodwaters contribute to the supply of fertilizers needed for a season of rice crop in the Mekong Delta?"""	The context does not provide specific information on how the annual deposition of sediment-bound nutrients from floodwaters contributes to the supply of fertilizers needed for a season of rice crop in the Mekong Delta.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1481\nThe high concentrations of As reduce the quality of rice har-\nvested in the RRD if As gets into soils and river waters indi-\nrectly through the usage of As-enriched groundwater (Fig.4).In a study on As accumulation in white rice from the Red\nRiver region in Vietnam, Phuong et al.(1999) reported As\nvalues of between 0.03 and 0.47 µg g−1d wt with the mean\nvalue at 0.21 µg g−1d wt.The mean value was higher than the\nmean value reported for Thai rice (0.14 µg g−1d wt; range:\n0.01 to 0.39 µg g−1) (Meharg et al., 2009).Lastly, although high As concentrations in groundwater\nare common in the RRD (cf.Berg et al., 2007; Luu, 2019;\nH. V .Pham et al., 2018; Winkel et al., 2011), there is no re-\nsearch on (groundwater induced) land subsidence in the Red\nRiver Delta.Thus, the magnitude of land subsidence in the\ndelta is uncertain and should be an area for future research.3.2 Regional anthropogenic drivers\n3.2.1 Upstream dams\nThe Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau and\nﬂows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo-\ndia and southern Vietnam.To meet growing demands for\nelectricity, many small- and large-scale hydropower projects\nhave been commissioned in each country to take advantage\nof this supposedly green and clean source of energy (Nhan\nand Cao, 2019; Manh et al., 2015).A total of 241 dams\nhave been completed in the entire Mekong basin, with an-\nother 29 under construction.A further 91 are currently be-\ning planned.These 361 dams consist of 176 hydropower\ndams and 185 irrigation dams.Of the 364 dams in the\nMekong, 20 are in Vietnamese territory (WLE Mekong\nCGIAR, 2020a).Conversely, the Red River originates in\nYunnan Province in China and ﬂows towards northern Viet-\nnam.It is less heavily dammed, with a total of 105 dams in\nChina and Vietnam.There are 25 hydropower dams, 3 multi-\npurpose dams and 9 irrigation dams in the Red River basin in\nVietnam (Vinh et al., 2014; WLE Mekong CGIAR, 2020b).While there are no dams in the Mekong River Delta or the\nRed River Delta due to their relatively ﬂat elevation, up-\nstream dam development inﬂuences downstream regions in\nmany ways, with the environmental impacts extending far\nbeyond the dam itself (Kondolf et al., 2014).Firstly, a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel and\nsuspended sediment is impounded in reservoirs behind the\ndams instead of being transported downstream.This dimin-\nished sediment load may aggravate erosion downstream from\nthe dam (Nhan and Cao, 2019; Fig.4).Using a network\nmodel, under a “deﬁnitive future” scenario of 38 new dams,\nthe cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River\nDelta would be 51 %.Conversely, under full build-up of\n133 new dams, only 4 % of the pre-dam sediment load will\nreach the delta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Manh et al.(2015)\nalso reached similar conclusions with a quasi-2D hydrody-\nnamic model of suspended sediment dynamics.Floodplainsedimentation would decrease by about 21 % to 96 %, while\nsediment load supplied to the sea at the river will diminish by\n1 % to 95 %, with the extreme values representing full dam\nbuild-up.Even if dam construction was limited to the river\ntributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment\ntrapped could be as high as 68 %, meaning that only about\n32 % of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River\nDelta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Indeed, Binh et al.(2020) found that the suspended sed-\niment loads in the MRD had decreased by 74.1 % in 2012–\n2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang\ncascade in China.', 'In particular, the Manwan and Dachaoshan\ndams contributed to 32 % of the reduction.In addition,\nfrom 2014–2017, the average incision rate of the Tien River\nin the MRD was 3 times higher than the previously recorded\nvalue.Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of\n14.8 % of the annual riverbed incision, while the remainder\nwas caused by hydropower dams upstream.The deleterious impacts of dams on sediment loads can\nalso be found in the Red River Delta in spite of the smaller\nnumber of dams.While the Hoa Binh dam is located on a\ntributary of the Red River in Vietnam, its large size has in-\nﬂuenced suspended sediment distribution in the lower Red\nRiver basin.For example, an analysis of the suspended sedi-\nment concentration over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010\nshowed that yearly suspended sediment ﬂux had dropped by\n61 % at Son Tay near Hanoi (Vinh et al., 2014).Similarly,\nDuc et al.(2012) calculated that the suspended sediment bud-\nget at Son Tay and Hanoi hydrological monitoring stations\nwas reduced by 56 % after the Hoa Binh dam became oper-\national in 1989.The reduction in sediment loads at the Red\nRiver Delta would likewise have a similar impact on delta\nsize and rice growing areas.Besides a change in sediment loads, dams also alter stream\ndischarge and water levels, with concurrent effects on wa-\nter supplies (not shown in Fig.4).When water levels are\nhigh during the rainy season, dams can be used to impound\nthe excess water in the reservoir behind.During the dry sea-\nson, when water levels are lower, the dams can release wa-\nter downstream.In doing so, dams increase dry-season dis-\ncharge and decrease wet-season discharge.The modiﬁcation\nof seasonal water ﬂows is problematic as changes in natu-\nral ﬂow patterns, such as higher ﬂows in the dry season and\nlower ﬂows in the wet season, would affect rice production\nas rice growing calendars are currently linked to the natu-\nral ﬂuctuations in high and low ﬂows (Robert, 2017).Hence,\nchanges in water levels due to anthropogenic interventions\nmay create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if plant-\ning calendars remain unchanged.In addition, lowered water\nlevels during dry seasons due to upstream water impound-\nment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion and create\nunfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021']
What are the measures taken to prevent salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how does sand mining affect the frequency of flooding and soil fertility in the region?	To prevent salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, measures such as the construction of sea dikes and salinization prevention dikes have been implemented. There are 1290 km of salinization prevention dikes and 450 km of sea dikes in the Mekong Delta.Sand mining in the Mekong Delta has significant effects on the frequency of flooding and soil fertility. The extraction of large quantities of riverbed sediments creates pits and pools that trap sediments from upstream, preventing them from contributing to the delta's growth. This process also leads to bed incision, causing land loss and threatening rice-growing areas. Moreover, aggressive sand mining disrupts natural flooding patterns. A study found that flood frequency in the Mekong River Delta dropped by 7.8% from 2005 to 2015 due to sand mining. This disruption in flood regimes results in reduced volumes of water and sediments for agricultural production. Floodwaters typically deposit fertile sediments and flush out accumulated pesticides and fertilizers from intensive agricultural production. When flood frequency decreases, the frequency at which farmlands benefit from this natural soil quality enhancement also decreases. This could lead to a decrease in soil fertility over time and result in declines in rice yields unless artificial fertilizers are added.	['1480 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nLikewise, the RRD is also heavily diked, with 3000 km of\nriver dikes (Fig.5), but unlike the MRD, high dikes are ab-\nsent (Pilarcyzk and Nguyen, 2005).Besides river and ﬂood\ncontrol dikes, there are also sea dikes and salinization pre-\nvention dikes in both deltas to protect the area from salinity\nintrusion.There are 1500 km of sea and estuary dikes in the\nRRD.In the MRD, there are 1290 km of salinization preven-\ntion dikes and 450 km of sea dikes (Le et al., 2018; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005; Fig.4).3.1.4 Sand mining\nSand mining is carried out on a large scale in the Mekong\n(Kondolf et al., 2018).Fueled by demand from reclamation,\nexport and construction, 55.2 million tonnes of sediment\nwas extracted from the Mekong main stem in Laos, Thai-\nland, Cambodia and Vietnam from 2011 to 2012 (Bravard\nand Gaillot, 2013; Robert, 2017).A more recent analysis of\nbathymetric maps and the local reﬁlling processes by Jor-\ndan et al.(2019) put the amount of sand extracted from the\nMekong River Delta in 2018 at 17.77 Mm3.Besides removing large quantities of riverbed sediments,\nsand mining operations have created numerous pits and\npools.These pits and pools, which can be up to 45 m deep,\nthen become sediment traps, trapping bed loads from up-\nstream reaches and preventing them from traveling down-\nstream and contributing to the continued presence and\ngrowth of the delta.In addition, bed incision also occurs\nas the water is sediment-starved.The down-cutting of river-\nbanks can propagate upstream and downstream from the ex-\ntraction sites for many kilometers, in turn affecting river\necosystems over a large area (Kondolf et al., 2018).This bank\nincision results in land loss, which threatens rice growing ar-\neas (Fig.4).Aggressive sand mining also disrupts natural ﬂooding.A\nrecent study of the effects of riverine mining on ﬂood fre-\nquency in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle (LXQ) in the Mekong\nRiver Delta found that ﬂood frequency had dropped by 7.8 %\nfrom 2005–2015.Water levels at local gauge stations also\nshowed an overall decreasing trend, indicating that the low-\nering of the riverbed had reduced the frequency of ﬂooding.Disrupted ﬂood regimes result in reduced volumes of water\nand sediments for agricultural production.In addition, ﬂood-\nwaters typically deposit fertile sediments while ﬂushing the\npesticides and fertilizers accumulated from intensive agricul-\ntural production.When the ﬂood frequency decreases, the\nfrequency at which farmlands beneﬁt from this natural soil\nquality enhancement decreases.Consequently, soil fertility\nmay decrease over time and lead to declines in rice yields un-\nless artiﬁcial fertilizers are added (Park et al., 2020; Fig.4).While there are several studies on the diffuse, yet insidious\nnature of sand mining in the Mekong (cf.Bravard and Gail-\nlot, 2013; Brunier et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2019; Kondolf\net al., 2018; Park et al., 2020; Robert, 2017; Schmitt et al.,\n2017), the extent of sand mining in the Red River Delta isunclear as there is almost no research on this issue.We did\nhowever come across an article in a Vietnamese newspaper\nabout rampant sand mining in the Red River and how min-\ning operations have caused erosion in nearby villages (Chinh,\n2018).Similar to the situation in the MRD, the authorities\nhave turned a blind eye to this illegal business (Bravard and\nGaillot, 2013; Chinh, 2018).3.1.5 Groundwater extraction\nAnother example of an anthropogenic development creating\nother interrelated problems is that of groundwater extraction.', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

"""How has the increased groundwater extraction affected the land subsidence and the severity of saltwater intrusion in the Mekong River Delta, and what impact does this have on the suitability of land for rice cultivation?"""	Increased groundwater extraction has led to an increase in land subsidence in the Mekong River Delta, with subsidence rates from groundwater extraction ranging between 1.1 and 2.5 cm per year. This has resulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence over 25 years since 1991, with some areas recording over 30 cm of subsidence. This subsidence has exacerbated the severity and extent of saltwater intrusion. The combination of land subsidence and saltwater intrusion has reduced the suitability of land for rice cultivation. Furthermore, rice crops can become contaminated with arsenic when arsenic-rich groundwater used for non-agricultural use is discharged into rivers, and the river water is then used for rice irrigation. This reduces the quality of the rice crops.	['While groundwater extraction has increased the availability\nof water for human activities, it has exacerbated land subsi-\ndence, which has increased the severity and extent of salt-\nwater intrusion and reduced the suitability of land for rice\ncultivation (Fig.4).Minderhoud et al.(2017) developed a\n3D numerical groundwater ﬂow model of the MRD surface\nand found that subsidence rates from groundwater extraction\nwere between 1.1 and 2.5 cm yr−1.The model also showed\nthat 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 had re-\nsulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence, with\nsome hotspots recording over 30 cm of subsidence.Land sub-\nsidence from excessive groundwater extraction acts as a cat-\nalyst that increases vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and\nreduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.Moreover, rice crops become contaminated with arsenic\nwhen arsenic-rich groundwater used for non-agricultural use\nis discharged into rivers, and the river water is used for rice ir-\nrigation (Lan and Giao, 2017; Minderhoud et al., 2018).High\narsenic concentrations in groundwater seem to be of natu-\nral origin.In the Mekong River Delta, naturally occurring\nbiochemical and hydrological processes cause As to be re-\nleased from Fe oxides in rocks and sediments into groundwa-\nter reservoirs (Fendorf et al., 2010).In addition, deep ground-\nwater extraction causes interbedded clays to compact and ex-\npel water containing dissolved As (Erban et al., 2013).Crop\nquality is reduced when the arsenic-enriched water is de-\nposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth\n(Rahman and Hasegawa, 2011; Fig.4).Similarly, prevalence of groundwater extraction is also\nhigh in the Red River Delta.Approximately 70 % of the\npopulation living in the RRD accesses water from Holocene\nand Pleistocene aquifers (Berg et al., 2007; Winkel et al.,\n2011).Groundwater in the Red River Delta is also contam-\ninated with high levels of As due to reductive dissolution\nof As from iron oxyhydroxides in buried sediment (Berg et\nal., 2007; Luu, 2019).Berg et al.(2007) sampled 196 tube\nwells randomly over a 700 km2area in the Red River Delta,\nand the concentrations of As in groundwater ranged from\n1 to 3050 µg L−1, with an average of 159 µg L−1.Separately,\nWinkel et al.(2011) collected 512 water samples from pri-\nvate wells in the Red River ﬂoodplain and found As concen-\ntrations varying from <0.1 to 810 µg L−1, with 27 % of the\nsamples exceeding the WHO guideline value of 10 µg L−1.Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.']
What is the impact of upstream dam development on the sediment load reaching the Mekong River Delta and how might this affect erosion in the region?	Upstream dam development can significantly reduce the sediment load reaching the Mekong River Delta. For instance, under a scenario of 38 new dams, the cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River Delta could be 51%. If 133 new dams were built, only 4% of the pre-dam sediment load might reach the delta. This diminished sediment load could exacerbate erosion downstream from the dam. For example, the Manwan and Dachaoshan dams contributed to a 32% reduction in sediment load. Furthermore, sand mining was responsible for up to 14.8% of the annual riverbed incision, with the remainder caused by hydropower dams upstream. Therefore, upstream dam development could potentially lead to increased erosion in the Mekong River Delta.	['In particular, the Manwan and Dachaoshan\ndams contributed to 32 % of the reduction.In addition,\nfrom 2014–2017, the average incision rate of the Tien River\nin the MRD was 3 times higher than the previously recorded\nvalue.Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of\n14.8 % of the annual riverbed incision, while the remainder\nwas caused by hydropower dams upstream.The deleterious impacts of dams on sediment loads can\nalso be found in the Red River Delta in spite of the smaller\nnumber of dams.While the Hoa Binh dam is located on a\ntributary of the Red River in Vietnam, its large size has in-\nﬂuenced suspended sediment distribution in the lower Red\nRiver basin.For example, an analysis of the suspended sedi-\nment concentration over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010\nshowed that yearly suspended sediment ﬂux had dropped by\n61 % at Son Tay near Hanoi (Vinh et al., 2014).Similarly,\nDuc et al.(2012) calculated that the suspended sediment bud-\nget at Son Tay and Hanoi hydrological monitoring stations\nwas reduced by 56 % after the Hoa Binh dam became oper-\national in 1989.The reduction in sediment loads at the Red\nRiver Delta would likewise have a similar impact on delta\nsize and rice growing areas.Besides a change in sediment loads, dams also alter stream\ndischarge and water levels, with concurrent effects on wa-\nter supplies (not shown in Fig.4).When water levels are\nhigh during the rainy season, dams can be used to impound\nthe excess water in the reservoir behind.During the dry sea-\nson, when water levels are lower, the dams can release wa-\nter downstream.In doing so, dams increase dry-season dis-\ncharge and decrease wet-season discharge.The modiﬁcation\nof seasonal water ﬂows is problematic as changes in natu-\nral ﬂow patterns, such as higher ﬂows in the dry season and\nlower ﬂows in the wet season, would affect rice production\nas rice growing calendars are currently linked to the natu-\nral ﬂuctuations in high and low ﬂows (Robert, 2017).Hence,\nchanges in water levels due to anthropogenic interventions\nmay create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if plant-\ning calendars remain unchanged.In addition, lowered water\nlevels during dry seasons due to upstream water impound-\nment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion and create\nunfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'K.

V .Pham et al., 2018; Winkel et al., 2011), there is no re-\nsearch on (groundwater induced) land subsidence in the Red\nRiver Delta.Thus, the magnitude of land subsidence in the\ndelta is uncertain and should be an area for future research.3.2 Regional anthropogenic drivers\n3.2.1 Upstream dams\nThe Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau and\nﬂows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo-\ndia and southern Vietnam.To meet growing demands for\nelectricity, many small- and large-scale hydropower projects\nhave been commissioned in each country to take advantage\nof this supposedly green and clean source of energy (Nhan\nand Cao, 2019; Manh et al., 2015).A total of 241 dams\nhave been completed in the entire Mekong basin, with an-\nother 29 under construction.A further 91 are currently be-\ning planned.These 361 dams consist of 176 hydropower\ndams and 185 irrigation dams.Of the 364 dams in the\nMekong, 20 are in Vietnamese territory (WLE Mekong\nCGIAR, 2020a).Conversely, the Red River originates in\nYunnan Province in China and ﬂows towards northern Viet-\nnam.It is less heavily dammed, with a total of 105 dams in\nChina and Vietnam.There are 25 hydropower dams, 3 multi-\npurpose dams and 9 irrigation dams in the Red River basin in\nVietnam (Vinh et al., 2014; WLE Mekong CGIAR, 2020b).While there are no dams in the Mekong River Delta or the\nRed River Delta due to their relatively ﬂat elevation, up-\nstream dam development inﬂuences downstream regions in\nmany ways, with the environmental impacts extending far\nbeyond the dam itself (Kondolf et al., 2014).Firstly, a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel and\nsuspended sediment is impounded in reservoirs behind the\ndams instead of being transported downstream.This dimin-\nished sediment load may aggravate erosion downstream from\nthe dam (Nhan and Cao, 2019; Fig.4).Using a network\nmodel, under a “deﬁnitive future” scenario of 38 new dams,\nthe cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River\nDelta would be 51 %.Conversely, under full build-up of\n133 new dams, only 4 % of the pre-dam sediment load will\nreach the delta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Manh et al.(2015)\nalso reached similar conclusions with a quasi-2D hydrody-\nnamic model of suspended sediment dynamics.Floodplainsedimentation would decrease by about 21 % to 96 %, while\nsediment load supplied to the sea at the river will diminish by\n1 % to 95 %, with the extreme values representing full dam\nbuild-up.Even if dam construction was limited to the river\ntributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment\ntrapped could be as high as 68 %, meaning that only about\n32 % of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River\nDelta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Indeed, Binh et al.(2020) found that the suspended sed-\niment loads in the MRD had decreased by 74.1 % in 2012–\n2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang\ncascade in China.']
"""How do changes in water levels due to dams and other human interventions potentially increase saltwater intrusion and create unfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers in the Mekong Delta?"""	Changes in water levels due to dams and other human interventions can potentially increase saltwater intrusion and create unfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers in the Mekong Delta in several ways. Upstream dams can affect sediment accumulation as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, which impacts the fertility of the soil in the delta. Groundwater extraction can cause land subsidence, which in turn can lead to saltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, negatively affecting rice growing areas and the quality of rice produced. Additionally, anthropogenic developments like dikes, while designed to keep floodwaters and salt intrusion out, can result in a reduction in fertile silt deposits. Furthermore, climate change can exacerbate these effects by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters, which can intensify problems such as saltwater flooding and saltwater intrusion.

Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021;

How does the occurrence of typhoons, which can cause saltwater flooding, affect rice production in the Mekong Delta, considering that rice is not adapted to withstand prolonged submergence and/or saline conditions?	Typhoons can have a significant impact on rice production in the Mekong Delta. When a typhoon occurs, the affected areas are exposed to strong winds and heavy rainfall, which can lead to widespread flooding. This flooding can be exacerbated by storm surges, which occur when high winds push on the ocean's surface combined with the effect of low pressure in the center of a typhoon. This can lead to saltwater flooding, which is particularly detrimental to rice crops as they are not adapted to withstand prolonged submergence or saline conditions. Therefore, the occurrence of typhoons, with their associated heavy precipitation, strong winds, and potential for saltwater flooding, can adversely affect rice production in the Mekong Delta.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1483\nIn terms of growth stage, rice plants at the tillering stage are\nmore likely to succumb to submergence than those at the veg-\netative stage.Plants fully submerged for short durations (2 d)\nalso had lower chances of survival than those that were par-\ntially submerged in ﬂoodwaters for longer durations (up to\n8 d).As such the effect of ﬂooding on rice growing areas is\nvariable as other factors that affect crop mortality include the\ntype of rice grown, the stage of rice growth, and the depth\nand length of submergence in ﬂoodwaters (Fig.6).Although severe ﬂooding can disrupt agricultural activi-\nties, moderate levels of freshwater ﬂooding bring beneﬁts\nto (rural) farmers (EEPSEA, 2011).Floodwaters from rivers\nimprove agricultural productivity by depositing nutrient-rich\nﬂood sediments on agricultural soils (Chapman et al., 2016).In addition, ﬂoods wash away contaminants, purify and\nrecharge aquifers, kill pests, and mitigate saltwater intrusion\n(EEPSEA, 2011; Hoang et al., 2018; Fig.6).Aquatic re-\nsources such as ﬁsh, crabs and snails also come in with the\nﬂoodwaters, which local farmers can collect to supplement\ntheir incomes.Besides growing rice, it is also possible to cul-\ntivate vegetables, ﬁsh, prawns and ducks in the ﬂooded ﬁelds\n(Nguyen and James, 2013).Towards the end of the ﬂooding\nseason and the start of the rice cultivation season, ﬂoodwa-\nters provide the water needed to start growing rice (Hoa et\nal., 2008).While there are investments in ﬂood prevention measures\nwith the construction and upgrading of river dikes, the con-\nstruction and dredging of reservoirs and drainage canals, and\nthe raising of roads and embankments, recent ﬂoods have\ncaused substantial agricultural losses as current measures\nhave proven to be inadequate (Hoa et al., 2008; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005).In 2018, 39 000 ha of rice in the RRD\nwas inundated by heavy rains and ﬂoods triggered by Ty-\nphoon Son-Tinh (VNA, 2018a).Similarly, due to a lack of\nembankments and/or poor construction and maintenance of\nexisting embankments, more than 2000 ha of rice was lost\nduring the annual ﬂoods in 2018.An Giang Province was the\nworst-affected, losing 1270 ha of rice (VNA, 2018b).3.3.3 Typhoons\nTyphoons are the most severe natural hazard that affects Viet-\nnam.When a typhoon occurs, affected areas are exposed to\nstrong winds of up to 50 m/s and up to 300 mm of rainfall\nin a day.As the rainy season in Vietnam coincides with the\ntyphoon season, widespread ﬂooding can be expected from\nheavy rain and overﬂowing rivers (CCFSC, 2005; Mai et\nal., 2009; K.-A.Nguyen et al., 2019).Storm surges can also\noccur when high winds pushing on the ocean’s surface are\ncombined with the effect of low pressure in the center of\na typhoon (Takagi et al., 2013).A study of typhoon disas-\nters in Vietnam since 1950 showed that half of the 450 ty-\nphoons recorded during the study period were accompanied\nby a storm surge of over 1 m, and 11 % were over 2.5 m high\n(Imamura and Van To, 1997).In the Red River Delta, Quynhet al.(1998) found that the maximum storm surge is usually\nbetween 1 to 1.5 m a.m.s.l.(above mean sea level).In short,\nrice production will be adversely affected by strong winds\nand widespread ﬂooding from heavy precipitation and storm\nsurges in the event of a typhoon.Saltwater ﬂooding may re-\nduce rice growing areas as rice is not adapted to withstand\nprolonged submergence and/or saline conditions.', '1482 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 6. Flow diagram showing the natural hazards that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. Local drivers refer to\nnatural hazards that occur within the two mega-deltas. Although sea level rise has implications on a local scale, it is considered a global\ndriver as it occurs on a global scale. The effect of ﬂooding on rice growing areas is variable as other factors that affect crop mortality include\nthe type of rice grown, the stage of rice growth, and the depth and length of submergence in ﬂoodwaters.\n3.3 Local natural-hazard drivers\n3.3.1 Drought\nDroughts do not result solely from a lack of rainfall; they\ncan also result from changes in the arrival of rains and the\nlength of the wet season (Adamson and Bird, 2010; Lassa et\nal., 2016). Vietnam was affected by droughts in 1997–1998,\n2002–2003, 2009–2010 and most recently in 2015–2016.\nThe 2015–2016 drought was the most severe in 90 years\n(Grosjean et al., 2016). All 13 provinces in the Mekong River\nDelta were affected by the 2015 drought. Besides a lack of\nwater for irrigation, the drought caused saltwater to intrude\nup to 70 km inland. Cumulatively, the drought and accompa-\nnying saltwater intrusion damaged 400 000 ha of rice crops,\nincluding 50 000 ha of paddy in Kien Giang and Ca Mau\nprovinces in the MRD (Grosjean et al., 2016; Nguyen, 2017).\nAlthough there is no research on how droughts and salinity\nintrusion have affected rice quality in Vietnam, research from\nelsewhere has shown that water shortages and salt stress in-\nduce physiochemical alterations which affect the rice grains\nproduced (Pandey et al., 2014; Razzaq et al., 2019; Fig. 6).\nCompared to the MRD, research and reports on droughts\nin the Red River Delta are scarce. The UNW-DPC (2014)reported that the RRD experienced droughts from the end\nof 1998 to April 1999, which affected 86 140 ha of rice. An-\nother drought occurred from January to February 2004, with\nthe water level of the Red River at the lowest in 40 years. Low\nwater levels were also reported in 2010; however drought\nconditions and saltwater intrusion were more severe in the\nMRD (Overland, 2010). The effect of droughts on rice agri-\nculture – reduced yields from a lack of water and salinity\nintrusion – would also be similar in the RRD.\n3.3.2 Freshwater ﬂooding\nRanked as the second most severe natural hazard after ty-\nphoons, freshwater ﬂoods are caused by overﬂowing rivers or\nheavy monsoonal rains or associated with heavy rain from ty-\nphoons (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Hung et al., 2012; McElwee\net al., 2017). Theoretically, ﬂooding reduces rice growing ar-\neas, but it is simplistic to assume that ﬂooded ﬁelds result in\nimmediate loss of rice crops. A study by Kotera et al. (2005)\nin the RRD showed that the type of rice, stage of rice growth,\nand lengths and depths of submergence were factors that in-\nﬂuence the survival rates of rice crops. For example, the local\nvariety Moc Tuyen was less resilient to submergence than\nthe two other genetically improved high-yielding varieties.\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Based on the context, how does the timing and location of a typhoon's landfall affect the extent of damage to rice crops in Vietnam?	The extent of damage to rice crops in Vietnam due to a typhoon is influenced by the timing and location of the typhoon's landfall. If a typhoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods, the agricultural losses can be significant. The landfall location also plays a crucial role. For instance, Typhoon Mirinae in 2016 made landfall in Nam Dinh and damaged or submerged a large area of rice, while Typhoon Nesat in 2011 made landfall in Hai Phong with similar intensity but caused significantly less damage. Furthermore, the intensity of the typhoon at landfall can also affect the extent of damage, as seen with Typhoon Kalmai in 2014, which was a slightly stronger storm and caused substantial rice damage.	['Addition-\nally, strong winds damage rice plants, with both effects con-\ntributing to a reduction in rice yields (Fig.6).Although a stronger typhoon usually brings higher wind\nspeeds, more rainfall, larger waves and higher storm surges\n(Larson et al., 2014), the quantity of agricultural losses de-\npends on factors such as landfall location(s) and whether the\ntyphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting\nperiods (Masutomi et al., 2012).For example, Typhoon Miri-\nnae (2016), which made landfall in Nam Dinh as a tropical\nstorm, damaged or submerged 225 216 ha of rice.Meanwhile\nTyphoon Nesat (2011) made landfall in Hai Phong with a\nsimilar intensity and caused only 3500 ha of rice damage.Conversely, Typhoon Kalmai (2014) made landfall in Quang\nNinh as a slightly stronger category 1 storm and caused\n20 000 ha of rice damage (Nhân Dân, 2014; United Nations\nVietnam, 2016; Viêt Nam News, 2011).An average of ﬁve to six typhoons affect Vietnam be-\ntween June and November every year (Larson et al., 2014;\nNguyen et al., 2007).Typhoon activity shifts from the north\nto the south as the year progresses.Therefore, peak activ-\nity in the north and southern part of Vietnam is in August\nand November, respectively (Imamura and Van To, 1997).We reviewed the Digital Typhoon (2021) database and found\n303 typhoons that came within 500 km of Vietnam’s coast-\nline from 1995 to 2018.A total of 29 cyclones made their\ninitial landfall in the Red River Delta, while only 4 cyclones\nmade landfall in the Mekong River Delta during the study pe-\nriod – one each in 1973, 1996, 1997 and 2006 (unpublished\nresults).Although the MRD is less prone to typhoons, two\nof the most recent typhoons caused signiﬁcant damage de-\nspite each being classiﬁed as a tropical storm upon landfall.Typhoon Linda (1997) caused some 349 232 ha of rice to be\nsubmerged, while Typhoon Durian (2006) damaged 6978 ha\nof agricultural land (International Federation of Red Cross\nand Red Crescent Society, 2006; UN Department of Human-\nitarian Affairs, 1997).Lastly, typhoons may not necessarily be bad all the time.Darby et al.(2016) combined suspended sediment load data\nfrom the Mekong River with hydrological model simulations\nto examine the role of typhoons in transporting suspended\nsediments and found that one-third (32 %) of the suspended\nsediment reaching the delta is delivered by runoff generated\nby rainfall associated with typhoons.When a typhoon affects\nareas upstream, the land receives higher-than-usual levels of\nrainfall, which may trigger landslides.This sediment can be\ntransferred into rivers and delivered downstream.While the\nrole of tropical typhoons in sediment mobilization is unclear\ngiven the lack of research in this area, such ﬁndings have\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'K.

Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1483\nIn terms of growth stage, rice plants at the tillering stage are\nmore likely to succumb to submergence than those at the veg-\netative stage.Plants fully submerged for short durations (2 d)\nalso had lower chances of survival than those that were par-\ntially submerged in ﬂoodwaters for longer durations (up to\n8 d).As such the effect of ﬂooding on rice growing areas is\nvariable as other factors that affect crop mortality include the\ntype of rice grown, the stage of rice growth, and the depth\nand length of submergence in ﬂoodwaters (Fig.6).Although severe ﬂooding can disrupt agricultural activi-\nties, moderate levels of freshwater ﬂooding bring beneﬁts\nto (rural) farmers (EEPSEA, 2011).Floodwaters from rivers\nimprove agricultural productivity by depositing nutrient-rich\nﬂood sediments on agricultural soils (Chapman et al., 2016).In addition, ﬂoods wash away contaminants, purify and\nrecharge aquifers, kill pests, and mitigate saltwater intrusion\n(EEPSEA, 2011; Hoang et al., 2018; Fig.6).Aquatic re-\nsources such as ﬁsh, crabs and snails also come in with the\nﬂoodwaters, which local farmers can collect to supplement\ntheir incomes.Besides growing rice, it is also possible to cul-\ntivate vegetables, ﬁsh, prawns and ducks in the ﬂooded ﬁelds\n(Nguyen and James, 2013).Towards the end of the ﬂooding\nseason and the start of the rice cultivation season, ﬂoodwa-\nters provide the water needed to start growing rice (Hoa et\nal., 2008).While there are investments in ﬂood prevention measures\nwith the construction and upgrading of river dikes, the con-\nstruction and dredging of reservoirs and drainage canals, and\nthe raising of roads and embankments, recent ﬂoods have\ncaused substantial agricultural losses as current measures\nhave proven to be inadequate (Hoa et al., 2008; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005).In 2018, 39 000 ha of rice in the RRD\nwas inundated by heavy rains and ﬂoods triggered by Ty-\nphoon Son-Tinh (VNA, 2018a).Similarly, due to a lack of\nembankments and/or poor construction and maintenance of\nexisting embankments, more than 2000 ha of rice was lost\nduring the annual ﬂoods in 2018.An Giang Province was the\nworst-affected, losing 1270 ha of rice (VNA, 2018b).3.3.3 Typhoons\nTyphoons are the most severe natural hazard that affects Viet-\nnam.When a typhoon occurs, affected areas are exposed to\nstrong winds of up to 50 m/s and up to 300 mm of rainfall\nin a day.As the rainy season in Vietnam coincides with the\ntyphoon season, widespread ﬂooding can be expected from\nheavy rain and overﬂowing rivers (CCFSC, 2005; Mai et\nal., 2009; K.-A.Nguyen et al., 2019).Storm surges can also\noccur when high winds pushing on the ocean’s surface are\ncombined with the effect of low pressure in the center of\na typhoon (Takagi et al., 2013).A study of typhoon disas-\nters in Vietnam since 1950 showed that half of the 450 ty-\nphoons recorded during the study period were accompanied\nby a storm surge of over 1 m, and 11 % were over 2.5 m high\n(Imamura and Van To, 1997).In the Red River Delta, Quynhet al.(1998) found that the maximum storm surge is usually\nbetween 1 to 1.5 m a.m.s.l.(above mean sea level).In short,\nrice production will be adversely affected by strong winds\nand widespread ﬂooding from heavy precipitation and storm\nsurges in the event of a typhoon.Saltwater ﬂooding may re-\nduce rice growing areas as rice is not adapted to withstand\nprolonged submergence and/or saline conditions.']
What are the potential impacts of sea level rise on rice production and food security in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?	The potential impacts of sea level rise on rice production and food security in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, include a reduction in the recurrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m height to once every 49 years. This could lead to breaches in inadequately constructed and poorly maintained dikes and embankments, resulting in saltwater flooding that damages rice growing areas and other properties. Rising sea levels, along with accelerated coastal subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction, could cause large portions of the low-lying areas to be inundated and flooded. This could facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients. Salinity intrusion could worsen during the dry season, affecting approximately 1.8 million ha in the Mekong Delta, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1. This area is predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea levels. Increased soil salinization could lead to a loss of land available for rice production.

Salinity intrusion can have detrimental effects on rice production in the Mekong Delta. It can lead to a decrease in the quality and quantity of rice produced. Climate change could exacerbate these effects by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as typhoons and sea level rise, which can induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.

"""What are the potential negative impacts of converting paddy fields to shrimp ponds in terms of soil salinity and availability of fresh water in the Mekong Delta?"""	The conversion of paddy fields to shrimp ponds can increase soil salinity and reduce the availability of fresh water. Over time, this can make it difficult for neighboring farmers who have not switched to aquaculture to plant rice, forcing them to seek alternative livelihoods. Additionally, the environmental conditions in these rice-shrimp systems can be suboptimal, contributing to low yields and survival. For instance, water temperature and salinity can be too high in the dry season and dissolved oxygen too low, causing most shrimps to die. For rice, the high soil salinity caused by the aquaculture pond can be a major limitation.	['1486 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nfarmers to come up with solutions for overcoming environ-\nmental limitations (Tran et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2012).Unfortunately, adaptations are not successful all the time.For example, the widespread conversion of paddy ﬁelds to\nshrimp ponds will increase soil salinity and reduce the avail-\nability of fresh water.Over time, neighbors who have not\nswitched to aquaculture may be unable to plant rice and\nwould have to seek alternative livelihoods (Nguyen et al.,\n2012).In addition, rice–shrimp systems are not problem-\nfree as well.Leigh et al.(2017) found that environmental\nconditions in rice–shrimp systems were suboptimal and con-\ntributed to low yields and survival.Water temperature and\nsalinity tended to be too high in the dry season and dissolved\noxygen too low, causing most shrimps to die.For rice, the\nhigh soil salinity caused by having the aquaculture pond was\na major limitation; in their study, only 3 out of 18 ponds pro-\nduced a harvestable rice crop.Apart from farmer-led initiatives related to crop and land-\nuse change, integrated pest management (IPM) should also\nbe adopted to reduce the use of pesticides to get rid of\npests.Farmers who practice IPM use a combination of\npest-resistant cultivars, fertilizer management and agronomic\npractices to increase the effects of predators and other natu-\nrally occurring biological control agents.For example, farm-\ners can grow ﬂowers, okra and beans along their paddy\nﬁelds to attract bees and wasps that infest planthopper pests’\neggs.With more natural predators around, pesticides are only\nused when necessary (Bottrell and Schoenly, 2012; Normile,\n2013).Alternatively, rice–ﬁsh farming and duck–rice sys-\ntems can also be implemented to provide a more economi-\ncally and ecologically sustainable alternative to intensive rice\nmonoculture (Berg and Tam, 2012; Men et al., 2002).In rice–ﬁsh farming, farmers use minimal pesticide as it\nkills the ﬁsh and the natural predators of rice pests.Instead,\nﬁsh help to control pests, and ﬁsh droppings keep the soil\nfertile.Upon maturity, the ﬁsh can be sold to increase the\nfarmer’s income by up to 30 % (Berg et al., 2017; Bosma\net al., 2012).Ducks can also be reared in immature rice\nﬁelds.Besides providing food, the ducks serve as biological\ncontrols for insects and weeds.Their droppings fertilize the\nsoils, and their movement aerates the water to beneﬁt the rice\nplants (Men et al., 2002, 2021).Men et al.(2002) showed that\na duck–rice system in Can Tho Province in the Mekong elim-\ninated the use of pesticides and halved the use of fertilizers,\nand the additional income from the sale of ducks increased\nfarmers’ incomes by 50 % to 150 %.Overall, the higher in-\ncomes and ecosystem services provided by the ﬁsh or ducks,\ncoupled with reduced agrochemical use, beneﬁt farmers.Increasingly, there are calls to move away from three to\ntwo rice crops a year in the MRD.Instead of planting a third\ncrop, ﬂoodwaters are allowed to enter the ﬁelds to replen-\nish soil nutrients, wash away contaminants, kill pests and\nmitigate salinity intrusion.Fish, crabs and snails that arrive\nwith the ﬂoodwaters can be collected for additional income.Triple-cropping of rice provides only a single ecosystem ser-vice, which is marketable rice.On the other hand, the integra-\ntion of rice cropping with natural ﬂooding creates a series of\npositive feedback mechanisms and ecosystem services that\ninclude providing natural pest control and facilitating nutri-\nent cycling (Nikula, 2008; Tong, 2017).', 'K.

"""What are the potential impacts of land-use patterns and natural hazards on rice agriculture in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam?"""	Land-use patterns and natural hazards can significantly impact rice agriculture in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam. Anthropogenic land-use changes, such as the shift from rice monoculture to non-rice crops due to higher prices and rising demand for aquaculture and non-rice products, have affected rice productivity. Environmental threats like saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas, forcing many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or grow salt-tolerant crops like coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion has also reduced rice-growing areas, although agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high despite shrinking areas.The construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields. However, these high dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Non-related anthropogenic factors like sand mining and upstream dam construction, which reduce sediment availability and increase channel erosion, can also adversely affect agricultural productivity.Natural hazards such as typhoons, floods, and droughts can also damage rice crops. Typhoons can cause damage through strong winds and flooding from heavy rain, especially if they occur during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods. Floods can be caused by heavy monsoonal rains, and while moderate levels of freshwater flooding may be beneficial to agricultural production, severe floods can be damaging. Droughts, although uncommon, have caused significant economic loss, particularly in the agriculture sector. For instance, the 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong River Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 million in damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and aquaculture-related damage.	['1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.', '1492 K.

"""How do human activities and natural hazards, such as typhoons and sea level rise, contribute to saltwater flooding and worsen salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how might these issues be exacerbated by climate change?"""	Human activities such as the construction of dikes and embankments, sand mining, upstream dams, and groundwater extraction can contribute to saltwater flooding and worsen salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta. Dikes and embankments are designed to keep out floodwaters and salt intrusion, but they can reduce fertile silt deposits. Sand mining and upstream dams can reduce the frequency of natural freshwater flooding and affect sediment accumulation, as sediments get trapped in reservoirs upstream. Groundwater extraction can cause land subsidence, which can lead to saltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination. Natural hazards like typhoons and sea level rise can also induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion. Typhoons can cause severe flooding, while sea level rise can lead to the inundation and flooding of low-lying areas, facilitating the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers. Climate change can exacerbate these issues by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters like typhoons. Rising sea levels, a consequence of climate change, can potentially reduce rice growing areas in the future. This can lead to an increase in problems such as excessive saltwater flooding and saltwater intrusion.	['K. W.

"""What are the potential impacts of decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise on the survival of the Mekong Delta, as mentioned in the report?"""	Decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise can have significant impacts on the survival of the Mekong Delta. One of the potential impacts is the reduction in the recurrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m height to once every 49 years. This could lead to breaches in inadequately constructed and poorly maintained dikes and embankments, resulting in saltwater flooding. This flooding can damage rice growing areas and other properties. Rising sea levels, along with accelerated coastal subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction, can cause large portions of the low-lying areas to be inundated and flooded. This can facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients. Salinity intrusion can worsen during the dry season, affecting large areas already impacted by dry-season salinity. Increased soil salinization can lead to a loss of land available for rice production. Even though there are sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices in place to reduce incursions of seawater, they may be inadequate if not well maintained and upgraded.	['(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

Based on the context, what are the potential impacts of river-bed mining on the destabilisation of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	River-bed mining, specifically sand mining, in the Mekong Delta has several destabilizing effects. Large quantities of riverbed sediments are removed, creating numerous pits and pools that can be up to 45 meters deep. These pits and pools act as sediment traps, preventing sediments from traveling downstream and contributing to the delta's growth. The extraction process also leads to bed incision, or the down-cutting of riverbanks, which can propagate for many kilometers from the extraction sites, affecting river ecosystems over a large area. This results in land loss, threatening rice growing areas. Sand mining also disrupts natural flooding. A study found that flood frequency in the Mekong River Delta dropped by 7.8% from 2005–2015 due to riverine mining. This disruption leads to reduced volumes of water and sediments for agricultural production. Floodwaters typically deposit fertile sediments and flush out pesticides and fertilizers from intensive agricultural production. When flood frequency decreases, the frequency at which farmlands benefit from this natural soil quality enhancement also decreases. This could lead to a decrease in soil fertility over time and result in declines in rice yields unless artificial fertilizers are added.	['1480 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nLikewise, the RRD is also heavily diked, with 3000 km of\nriver dikes (Fig.5), but unlike the MRD, high dikes are ab-\nsent (Pilarcyzk and Nguyen, 2005).Besides river and ﬂood\ncontrol dikes, there are also sea dikes and salinization pre-\nvention dikes in both deltas to protect the area from salinity\nintrusion.There are 1500 km of sea and estuary dikes in the\nRRD.In the MRD, there are 1290 km of salinization preven-\ntion dikes and 450 km of sea dikes (Le et al., 2018; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005; Fig.4).3.1.4 Sand mining\nSand mining is carried out on a large scale in the Mekong\n(Kondolf et al., 2018).Fueled by demand from reclamation,\nexport and construction, 55.2 million tonnes of sediment\nwas extracted from the Mekong main stem in Laos, Thai-\nland, Cambodia and Vietnam from 2011 to 2012 (Bravard\nand Gaillot, 2013; Robert, 2017).A more recent analysis of\nbathymetric maps and the local reﬁlling processes by Jor-\ndan et al.(2019) put the amount of sand extracted from the\nMekong River Delta in 2018 at 17.77 Mm3.Besides removing large quantities of riverbed sediments,\nsand mining operations have created numerous pits and\npools.These pits and pools, which can be up to 45 m deep,\nthen become sediment traps, trapping bed loads from up-\nstream reaches and preventing them from traveling down-\nstream and contributing to the continued presence and\ngrowth of the delta.In addition, bed incision also occurs\nas the water is sediment-starved.The down-cutting of river-\nbanks can propagate upstream and downstream from the ex-\ntraction sites for many kilometers, in turn affecting river\necosystems over a large area (Kondolf et al., 2018).This bank\nincision results in land loss, which threatens rice growing ar-\neas (Fig.4).Aggressive sand mining also disrupts natural ﬂooding.A\nrecent study of the effects of riverine mining on ﬂood fre-\nquency in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle (LXQ) in the Mekong\nRiver Delta found that ﬂood frequency had dropped by 7.8 %\nfrom 2005–2015.Water levels at local gauge stations also\nshowed an overall decreasing trend, indicating that the low-\nering of the riverbed had reduced the frequency of ﬂooding.Disrupted ﬂood regimes result in reduced volumes of water\nand sediments for agricultural production.In addition, ﬂood-\nwaters typically deposit fertile sediments while ﬂushing the\npesticides and fertilizers accumulated from intensive agricul-\ntural production.When the ﬂood frequency decreases, the\nfrequency at which farmlands beneﬁt from this natural soil\nquality enhancement decreases.Consequently, soil fertility\nmay decrease over time and lead to declines in rice yields un-\nless artiﬁcial fertilizers are added (Park et al., 2020; Fig.4).While there are several studies on the diffuse, yet insidious\nnature of sand mining in the Mekong (cf.Bravard and Gail-\nlot, 2013; Brunier et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2019; Kondolf\net al., 2018; Park et al., 2020; Robert, 2017; Schmitt et al.,\n2017), the extent of sand mining in the Red River Delta isunclear as there is almost no research on this issue.We did\nhowever come across an article in a Vietnamese newspaper\nabout rampant sand mining in the Red River and how min-\ning operations have caused erosion in nearby villages (Chinh,\n2018).Similar to the situation in the MRD, the authorities\nhave turned a blind eye to this illegal business (Bravard and\nGaillot, 2013; Chinh, 2018).3.1.5 Groundwater extraction\nAnother example of an anthropogenic development creating\nother interrelated problems is that of groundwater extraction.', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

Sustainable adaptation strategies for rice agriculture in the Mekong Delta's An Giang Province, Vietnam, in the face of climate change and its effects such as salinity intrusion include the use of system dynamics modelling. This approach helps in evaluating the sustainability of different strategies. Additionally, sustainable rice cultivation in the deep flooded zones of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta has been explored. The strategies also consider the trade-offs between adaptation and development, particularly in relation to fluvial sediment deposition and the sustainability of rice-cropping.	['Chan, F. K.

"""What are the potential impacts of pumping-induced land subsidence on the release of arsenic to deep groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?"""	Pumping-induced land subsidence, caused by excessive groundwater extraction, can increase the vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and reduce the availability of land suitable for rice production. This subsidence can also lead to the compaction of interbedded clays, which expel water containing dissolved arsenic. This arsenic-enriched water can contaminate rice crops when it is discharged into rivers and used for irrigation. Furthermore, the arsenic in the groundwater appears to be of natural origin, released from iron oxides in rocks and sediments due to naturally occurring biochemical and hydrological processes.	['While groundwater extraction has increased the availability\nof water for human activities, it has exacerbated land subsi-\ndence, which has increased the severity and extent of salt-\nwater intrusion and reduced the suitability of land for rice\ncultivation (Fig.4).Minderhoud et al.(2017) developed a\n3D numerical groundwater ﬂow model of the MRD surface\nand found that subsidence rates from groundwater extraction\nwere between 1.1 and 2.5 cm yr−1.The model also showed\nthat 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 had re-\nsulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence, with\nsome hotspots recording over 30 cm of subsidence.Land sub-\nsidence from excessive groundwater extraction acts as a cat-\nalyst that increases vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and\nreduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.Moreover, rice crops become contaminated with arsenic\nwhen arsenic-rich groundwater used for non-agricultural use\nis discharged into rivers, and the river water is used for rice ir-\nrigation (Lan and Giao, 2017; Minderhoud et al., 2018).High\narsenic concentrations in groundwater seem to be of natu-\nral origin.In the Mekong River Delta, naturally occurring\nbiochemical and hydrological processes cause As to be re-\nleased from Fe oxides in rocks and sediments into groundwa-\nter reservoirs (Fendorf et al., 2010).In addition, deep ground-\nwater extraction causes interbedded clays to compact and ex-\npel water containing dissolved As (Erban et al., 2013).Crop\nquality is reduced when the arsenic-enriched water is de-\nposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth\n(Rahman and Hasegawa, 2011; Fig.4).Similarly, prevalence of groundwater extraction is also\nhigh in the Red River Delta.Approximately 70 % of the\npopulation living in the RRD accesses water from Holocene\nand Pleistocene aquifers (Berg et al., 2007; Winkel et al.,\n2011).Groundwater in the Red River Delta is also contam-\ninated with high levels of As due to reductive dissolution\nof As from iron oxyhydroxides in buried sediment (Berg et\nal., 2007; Luu, 2019).Berg et al.(2007) sampled 196 tube\nwells randomly over a 700 km2area in the Red River Delta,\nand the concentrations of As in groundwater ranged from\n1 to 3050 µg L−1, with an average of 159 µg L−1.Separately,\nWinkel et al.(2011) collected 512 water samples from pri-\nvate wells in the Red River ﬂoodplain and found As concen-\ntrations varying from <0.1 to 810 µg L−1, with 27 % of the\nsamples exceeding the WHO guideline value of 10 µg L−1.Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'Y ., Dea-\ncon, C., Villada, A., Cambell, R.

"""What are the potential impacts of sea-level rise and land-use changes on the flood risks in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam?"""	The potential impacts of sea-level rise and land-use changes on the flood risks in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam include increased vulnerability to flooding due to climate change and socioeconomic developments. Infrastructure effects can also exacerbate floods in the region. Additionally, the sustainability of rice-cropping, a significant agricultural activity in the region, could be threatened by fluvial sediment deposition. Furthermore, high dykes, while bringing social gains, can also cause environmental pains. These factors combined can pose significant challenges to managing flood risks in the Mekong Delta.

"""What are the regional consequences of seawater intrusion on rice productivity and land use in the coastal area of the Mekong River Delta, according to the report?"""	The report suggests that seawater intrusion can have significant impacts on rice productivity and land use in the coastal area of the Mekong River Delta. This intrusion can lead to increased salinity levels, which can affect the quality and quantity of rice produced. Additionally, it can also influence the land use patterns in these areas. However, the specific regional consequences are not detailed in the provided context.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '1490 K.

"""What are the impacts of land use and human activities on the Mekong Delta over the last 40 years, and how might these changes affect the quality of groundwater in Vietnam?"""	Over the last 40 years, land use and human activities have had significant impacts on the Mekong Delta. Industrial water pollution has been identified as a cause of rice yield loss, affecting the agrarian communities in the region. Additionally, sand mining activities have led to local sediment deficits. The construction of dams on the Mekong River has also resulted in cumulative sediment starvation. These changes can potentially affect the quality of groundwater in Vietnam. For instance, arsenic contamination in groundwater in the Red River delta has been reported. Furthermore, the conversion of agricultural land in peri-urban areas could also influence groundwater quality. However, the specific impacts of these land use changes and human activities on groundwater quality would require further research.

"""What are the impacts of 25 years of groundwater extraction on subsidence in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?"""	25 years of groundwater extraction in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, since 1991 has resulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence.

"""What are the drivers of change and potential adaptation pathways for agricultural systems in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam, particularly in relation to increased salinity intrusion due to climate change?"""	The drivers of change in the agricultural systems in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam include climate change, land-use change, and human activities such as river-bed mining and dyke construction. These changes have led to increased salinity intrusion, particularly in the Mekong Delta, affecting rice production. Adaptation pathways for these agricultural systems could involve implementing sustainable adaptation strategies, such as those used for rice agriculture in the Mekong Delta's An Giang Province. Additionally, addressing issues like illegal sand mining in the Red River could also be part of the solution. However, these adaptation strategies need to be evaluated using system dynamics modelling to ensure their sustainability.

"""What are the impacts of salinity intrusion on rice production in the Red River Delta under changing climate conditions, as mentioned in the context?"""	Salinity intrusion, which is expected to worsen with rising sea levels and during the dry season, can have significant impacts on rice production in the Red River Delta (RRD). This intrusion facilitates the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients in the RRD. This can lead to increased soil salinization, resulting in a loss of land available for rice production. Furthermore, climate change may exacerbate the effects of natural hazards, potentially increasing the frequency and severity of events like sea level rise, which can induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion. Existing sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices may be inadequate if not well maintained and upgraded, further exacerbating the problem.	['(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.']

"""What are the anticipated impacts of dam construction in the Mekong basin on the geomorphology of the Mekong Delta, according to Rubin, Kondolf, and Carling's study?"""	The context does not provide information on the anticipated impacts of dam construction in the Mekong basin on the geomorphology of the Mekong Delta according to Rubin, Kondolf, and Carling's study.	['In particular, the Manwan and Dachaoshan\ndams contributed to 32 % of the reduction.In addition,\nfrom 2014–2017, the average incision rate of the Tien River\nin the MRD was 3 times higher than the previously recorded\nvalue.Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of\n14.8 % of the annual riverbed incision, while the remainder\nwas caused by hydropower dams upstream.The deleterious impacts of dams on sediment loads can\nalso be found in the Red River Delta in spite of the smaller\nnumber of dams.While the Hoa Binh dam is located on a\ntributary of the Red River in Vietnam, its large size has in-\nﬂuenced suspended sediment distribution in the lower Red\nRiver basin.For example, an analysis of the suspended sedi-\nment concentration over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010\nshowed that yearly suspended sediment ﬂux had dropped by\n61 % at Son Tay near Hanoi (Vinh et al., 2014).Similarly,\nDuc et al.(2012) calculated that the suspended sediment bud-\nget at Son Tay and Hanoi hydrological monitoring stations\nwas reduced by 56 % after the Hoa Binh dam became oper-\national in 1989.The reduction in sediment loads at the Red\nRiver Delta would likewise have a similar impact on delta\nsize and rice growing areas.Besides a change in sediment loads, dams also alter stream\ndischarge and water levels, with concurrent effects on wa-\nter supplies (not shown in Fig.4).When water levels are\nhigh during the rainy season, dams can be used to impound\nthe excess water in the reservoir behind.During the dry sea-\nson, when water levels are lower, the dams can release wa-\nter downstream.In doing so, dams increase dry-season dis-\ncharge and decrease wet-season discharge.The modiﬁcation\nof seasonal water ﬂows is problematic as changes in natu-\nral ﬂow patterns, such as higher ﬂows in the dry season and\nlower ﬂows in the wet season, would affect rice production\nas rice growing calendars are currently linked to the natu-\nral ﬂuctuations in high and low ﬂows (Robert, 2017).Hence,\nchanges in water levels due to anthropogenic interventions\nmay create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if plant-\ning calendars remain unchanged.In addition, lowered water\nlevels during dry seasons due to upstream water impound-\nment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion and create\nunfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

"""What are the potential impacts of rising sea levels on the Mekong Delta, as discussed in the provided context?"""	Rising sea levels could have several impacts on the Mekong Delta. They could reduce the recurrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m height to once every 49 years. This could lead to breaches in inadequately constructed and poorly maintained dikes and embankments, resulting in saltwater flooding that damages rice growing areas and other properties. Rising sea levels, along with accelerated coastal subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction, could cause large portions of the low-lying areas to be inundated and flooded. This could facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients. Salinity intrusion could worsen during the dry season, affecting approximately 1.8 million ha in the Mekong Delta, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1. This area is predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea levels. Increased soil salinization could lead to a loss of land available for rice production. Existing sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices may be inadequate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.	['(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'Hens, L., Thinh, N.

Based on the provided context, how has the transformation of agriculture and rural life downstream of Hanoi impacted rice farming in the Mekong Delta?	The transformation of agriculture and rural life downstream of Hanoi has significantly impacted rice farming in the Mekong Delta. Rapid urbanization has led to the loss of agricultural land, with a significant amount of this land-use conversion occurring in peri-urban areas. This has resulted in a decline in rice growing areas. Additionally, high land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land have forced farmers to practice agricultural intensification. Furthermore, environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Government policies encouraging farmers to move away from growing rice have also contributed to the planting of more non-rice crops on paddy land. Moreover, the construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields. However, these high dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Lastly, rice crops in the Mekong Delta are susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as typhoons, floods, and droughts. These factors have all contributed to the transformation of rice farming in the Mekong Delta.	['1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.', '1478 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 4. Flow diagram showing the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. The drivers\nare classiﬁed as a local driver if it occurs in the two mega-deltas. Regional drivers are those that occur farther away from the two mega-deltas\nbut within the Asian region. A plus ( +) sign indicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to increase (decrease). A negative ( −) sign\nindicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to decrease (increase). Dashed lines with “ ±” are used when outcomes are unclear. For\nexample, dikes reduce ﬂooding, but poorly maintained or planned dikes increase ﬂooding instead. In addition, dikes may potentially cause\nﬂooding in unprotected areas. Agrochemical use may reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but the overuse of chemicals can lead to\npesticide resistance, which may increase outbreaks of pests and diseases.\nFinally, government policies encouraging farmers to move\naway from growing rice also contributed to the planting of\nmore non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is\nincreased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards,\nand freshwater and brackish aquaculture (Van Kien et al.,\n2020). Using remote sensing to assess land-use and land-\ncover change in the Mekong River Delta, Liu et al. (2020)\nfound that aquaculture had become the second-largest land-\nuse type, following planted land. This was facilitated by gov-\nernment regulations, salt intrusion and higher proﬁtability\nof aquaculture productions. In any case, even though farm-\ners may have moved on from growing rice, many still con-\ntinue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops\n(Normile, 2013; Fig. 4).\n3.1.2 Urban expansion\nRapid urbanization is accelerating the loss of agricultural\nland in both the Red River Delta and Mekong River Delta. In\nHanoi, a major city in the Red River Delta, 1420 ha of agri-cultural land was lost per year from 2000–2007, equivalent to\na yearly loss of 3 %. By 2025, up to 450 000 ha of agricultural\nland is expected to be converted to urban land. Most of this\nland-use conversion occurs in peri-urban areas 5–15 km from\nthe city center. The same peri-urban land is often used to\ngrow food, ﬂowers and livestock for the urban population in\nHanoi. However, this land is considered by local authorities\nto be land reserve for urban planning instead of resources for\nfood supply (Drebold, 2017; Pham et al., 2015). Most of this\nperi-urban agricultural land is often forcibly obtained, with\nminimal compensation given to farmers, and then sold to for-\neign developers (Drebold, 2017). Similar urban expansion is\nalso occurring in Can Tho city in the Mekong River Delta,\nwith corresponding losses of agricultural land (cf. Garscha-\ngen et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2010). A decline in agricultural\nland means a decline in rice growing areas as well (Fig. 4).\nHigh land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land\nhave forced farmers to practice agricultural intensiﬁcation. In\nthe RRD, rice production grew more than 25 % from 2000–\n2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

What are the main environmental threats to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and how does the intrusion of saline water affect the region's agriculture and freshwater supply?	The Mekong Delta in Vietnam faces several environmental threats, including the impact of upstream hydropower dams, climate change, and sea level rise. These factors can alter the hydrodynamics of the region, leading to increased salinity intrusion. Salinity intrusion, in turn, can have significant impacts on the region's agriculture and freshwater supply. For instance, it can affect the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping, a crucial agricultural activity in the region. Additionally, the increased salinity can also pose a risk to the overall sustainability of the Mekong Delta.

What are the four identified causes of the recent increase in saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how does riverbed sand mining contribute to this issue?	The four identified causes of the recent increase in saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta are upstream dam construction, sea level rise, land subsidence, and riverbed mining. Riverbed mining contributes to this issue by causing riverbed incision, which is the lowering of the riverbed due to the removal of sediment. This process can alter the balance between fresh and saline water in the delta, leading to increased saline water intrusion. The incision rates from riverbed mining are considered to be the most underestimated, and controlling the sediment excavation volumes is suggested as a strategy to slow down these rates and mitigate the intrusion of saline water.	"[""exclusively associated with the reach of the Mekong with the highest\nriverbed mining risks, i.e.Tan Chau to My Thuan.Accordingly, we spec-\nulated that the IR caused from dams would also vary, ranging from\n15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020b ).For SLR and LS, we refer to the previously published results, respectivelyreporting the IRs of 1.5 –2 cm/year and 0.82 cm/year ( Eslami et al., 2019 ;\nMinderhoud et al., 2017 ).Among the estimated IRs, we consider that\nthe riverbed mining is the most likely to be underestimated.This isdue to the generalization of the IR across the VMD using the values\ndriven from local-scale survey, and the crude characterization of ba-\nthymetry in the VMD, which is based on extrapolation of the single\nbeam echosounder ( Binh et al., 2020b ).Admittedly, advanced bathym-\netry survey methods such as multibeam echosounder (MBES) mighthave resulted in more accurate estimations of riverbend incision rates.However, covering the world's third largest delta using MBES would\nnot be feasible in terms of time and cost.Plus, given the absence of\nother viable alternatives, what we propose here could lay an important\ngroundwork that can inspire following up research for improvements\nfrom the relevant scienti ﬁc community.The resulting IRs, estimation\nmethods, and the key references are summarized in Table 3 .4.2.Policy outlooks - the need for both integrated and adaptive approaches\n4.2.1.Evidence-based priority of countermeasures\nAccording to our initial assessment on IRs presented in Table 3 ,t h e\nupstream dams have the most signi ﬁcant impact, followed by the river-\nbed mining, SLR and LS, constituting an evidence-based priority for\ndealing with the SI intensifying drivers.However, the major discrepan-\ncies in politics, philosophies and economic interests among the coun-\ntries sharing the Mekong River water resources ( Kansal et al., 2019 )\nwould make negotiating over the hydropower dams with the upstreamcountries an uphill battle for the Vietnam government.In contrast, the\nthree domestic issues should be more immediately manageable with\nregulatory and enforcement measures at different administration levels.Accordingly, with a speci ﬁc consideration of the three domestic pres-\nsures contributing to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, riverbed mining has the\nhighest IRs and substantially higher than those of SLR and LS.It is there-\nfore underlined that mitigating the intrusion of saline water in the VMD\nshould ﬁrst work on strategies to slow down the IR contributing from\nriverbed mining by controlling the sediment excavation volumes.Thiscall for bold, nation-wide actions to decisively control the exports of\nthe riverbed sediments while raising the disciplinary actions against il-\nlegal mining to effectively halt the sinking rate of the delta and safe-\nguard the livelihood of millions of inhabitants.4.2.2.Encouraging eco-based livelihoods for better adaptations\nLivelihood adaptation to salinity intrusion is another key aspect for\npolicy reforms.Our study has indicated how the saline water protrudes\nfurther inland and on a more frequent basis.Other studies have already\nshown how SI and other environmental pressures put millions of inhab-\nitants at critical risks ( Park et al., 2020a ;Park et al., 2020b ;Tamura et al.,\n2020 ;Loc et al., 2020a, 2020b ;Pham et al., 2020 ).Active adaptation to\nsalinity intrusion and living with salinity has also been put on the policy\nagenda with the Mekong Delta Plan (2013) , Resolution 120 in 2017.Moreover, agricultural models are increasingly adopted that thrive onsalinity intrusion.Basically, there are two options.Either farmersadapt their cropping to the wet-dry seasonality and grow a brackish\ncrop during the dry season ( Loc et al., 2017, 2018, 2020a, 2020b ;Tan\net al., 2020 ;Pham et al., 2020 ).The rice-shrimp system is well adapted\nto the regular rain-dry season spell, where a decent crop of rice can be\nharvested during the wet season, followed by the raising of an extensivecrop\nof shrimp."", ""Sea level rise\nDam constructioncaused by the riverbed incision.Finally, we introduc e a novel approach using the annual incision rates of the\nriverbed to compare four SI driving factors in terms of t heir relative contributions to the balance between\nfresh and saline water in the VMD.©2 0 2 0E l s e v i e rB .V .A l lr i g h t sr e s e r v e d .1.Introduction\nThe Mekong River originates from the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau, runs\nacross China and ﬁve other countries, and forms the Vietnamese Me-\nkong Delta (VMD) at the downstream course before draining into the\nEast Sea.With a total area of more than 4 million ha, VMD houses 17\nmillion people and accounts for half of the country's food supplies.With the current productivity of ~25 million tons of rice every year,\nVMD not only safeguards the country's food security but also contrib-\nutes about 18.7% of the national GDP through agricultural products ex-\nports ( Dung et al., 2019 ;Eslami et al., 2019 ;GSO, 2016 ;Piesse, 2019 ).The sustainable development of this important food basket, however,is under several internal and external environmental pressures (e.g.Arias et al., 2019 ;Trung and Thanh, 2013 ;Triet et al., 2017 ).Upstream,\nthere is the looming threat from the accelerated construction of hydro-power dams which have drastically modiﬁ ed the hydro-sedimentary\nregimes of the river (e.g.Anthony et al., 2015 ;Dinh et al., 2012 ;\nEslami et al., 2019 ;Van et al., 2012 ;Yang et al., 2019 ).Operation of\nthese dam reservoirs, combined with the downstream sea level rise(SLR) has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's\nshorelines ( Li et al., 2017 ).Internally in VMD, Park et al.(2020a) re-\nported on the constant decrease of ﬂood frequency over the past two\ndecades due to sand mining and dike construction in both the wet and\ndry seasons (1995 –2015).Several authors, including Brunier et al.(2014) ;Hackney et al.(2020) ;a n d Binh et al.(2020b) have also re-\nported signi ﬁcant geomorphic impacts due to extensive mining in the\nlower reach of the river such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank ero-\nsion.Likewise, due to the groundwater extraction, VMD is currently\nexperiencing land subsidence (LS) at an alarming rate; in the worst-\ncase scenario, this can be as much as a meter by 2050 ( Erban et al.,\n2014 ).Within the long list of environmental perils that VMD is facing, the\nintrusion of saline water is the main threat towards agriculturalproduction as it salinizes the essential freshwater resources, while\nsimultaneously degrading the soil on its penetration path.Annually, ap-\nproximately 2 million ha of agricultural land are prone to the risks of sa-\nlinity intrusion (SI) ( Smajgl et al., 2015 ;Toan, 2014 ).In addition, the\nintrusion of saline water can disrupt the supply of freshwater for bothdomestic (e.g.household daily use) and industrial consumers, especially\nin the coastal areas.Carew-Reid (2008) remarked that during dry sea-\nsons, strong northwestward winds combined with ﬂood tides and sea\nwater, can penetrate anywhere inland between 40 and 60 km from\nthe estuaries on both east and west coasts of the delta.While these\nnumbers seem signi ﬁcant, they pale in comparison to observations\nfrom the 2016 drought, which is the most severe event over the past90 years ( Kantoush et al., 2017 ).The event affected 12 out of 13 prov-\ninces in VMD (>2 million ha in area); of which were forced to declarea\nstate of natural disaster ( Toan, 2017 ).The total economic loss was es-\ntimated to be around 650 million USD, including 800,000 tons of ricecompletely lost.In addition, the lives of 17 million VMD inhabitants\nwere adversely affected.In 2020, the VMD experienced yet another cat-\nastrophic drought which possibly surpasses any historical records, in-\ncluding the ones observed in 2016 (From the local news: https://vtv.vn).""]"

What methods were used to analyze the changes in water levels, discharges, and salinity in the Mekong Delta, and how were these methods applied to assess the impact of salinity intrusion in the region?	The study used several methods to analyze the changes in water levels, discharges, and salinity in the Mekong Delta. Firstly, a hydrological dataset was collected and analyzed using a Mann-Kendall's test to validate the changing trends over time. Secondly, a Power Spectral Analysis of the water level data was conducted. This involved applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the hourly water level series at three stations - My Thuan, Hoa Binh, and Dai Ngai. This method was used to reveal the spectral peaks at different temporal oscillations by changing the original time-domain series to frequency-domain data. The FFT was applied to two different time periods (before and after 2000) over three stations, to investigate how the power spectral density of each cyclic effect has changed over recent time.Lastly, Rating Curves (RC) analysis was used to investigate intensified backwater effects. The RCs were derived from daily water level and discharge data for two temporally distant periods (between 1997 and 2016). By comparing the RCs over the two periods, the study assessed the evolutions of the backwater effect regimes over time, which in turn control the extent and intensity of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta. The analysis focused on the general characteristics of the RCs in different hydrological conditions and the changes on the RC slopes in the drought periods.

"[""Sea level rise\nDam constructioncaused by the riverbed incision.Finally, we introduc e a novel approach using the annual incision rates of the\nriverbed to compare four SI driving factors in terms of t heir relative contributions to the balance between\nfresh and saline water in the VMD.©2 0 2 0E l s e v i e rB .V .A l lr i g h t sr e s e r v e d .1.Introduction\nThe Mekong River originates from the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau, runs\nacross China and ﬁve other countries, and forms the Vietnamese Me-\nkong Delta (VMD) at the downstream course before draining into the\nEast Sea.With a total area of more than 4 million ha, VMD houses 17\nmillion people and accounts for half of the country's food supplies.With the current productivity of ~25 million tons of rice every year,\nVMD not only safeguards the country's food security but also contrib-\nutes about 18.7% of the national GDP through agricultural products ex-\nports ( Dung et al., 2019 ;Eslami et al., 2019 ;GSO, 2016 ;Piesse, 2019 ).The sustainable development of this important food basket, however,is under several internal and external environmental pressures (e.g.Arias et al., 2019 ;Trung and Thanh, 2013 ;Triet et al., 2017 ).Upstream,\nthere is the looming threat from the accelerated construction of hydro-power dams which have drastically modiﬁ ed the hydro-sedimentary\nregimes of the river (e.g.Anthony et al., 2015 ;Dinh et al., 2012 ;\nEslami et al., 2019 ;Van et al., 2012 ;Yang et al., 2019 ).Operation of\nthese dam reservoirs, combined with the downstream sea level rise(SLR) has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's\nshorelines ( Li et al., 2017 ).Internally in VMD, Park et al.(2020a) re-\nported on the constant decrease of ﬂood frequency over the past two\ndecades due to sand mining and dike construction in both the wet and\ndry seasons (1995 –2015).Several authors, including Brunier et al.(2014) ;Hackney et al.(2020) ;a n d Binh et al.(2020b) have also re-\nported signi ﬁcant geomorphic impacts due to extensive mining in the\nlower reach of the river such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank ero-\nsion.Likewise, due to the groundwater extraction, VMD is currently\nexperiencing land subsidence (LS) at an alarming rate; in the worst-\ncase scenario, this can be as much as a meter by 2050 ( Erban et al.,\n2014 ).Within the long list of environmental perils that VMD is facing, the\nintrusion of saline water is the main threat towards agriculturalproduction as it salinizes the essential freshwater resources, while\nsimultaneously degrading the soil on its penetration path.Annually, ap-\nproximately 2 million ha of agricultural land are prone to the risks of sa-\nlinity intrusion (SI) ( Smajgl et al., 2015 ;Toan, 2014 ).In addition, the\nintrusion of saline water can disrupt the supply of freshwater for bothdomestic (e.g.household daily use) and industrial consumers, especially\nin the coastal areas.Carew-Reid (2008) remarked that during dry sea-\nsons, strong northwestward winds combined with ﬂood tides and sea\nwater, can penetrate anywhere inland between 40 and 60 km from\nthe estuaries on both east and west coasts of the delta.While these\nnumbers seem signi ﬁcant, they pale in comparison to observations\nfrom the 2016 drought, which is the most severe event over the past90 years ( Kantoush et al., 2017 ).The event affected 12 out of 13 prov-\ninces in VMD (>2 million ha in area); of which were forced to declarea\nstate of natural disaster ( Toan, 2017 ).The total economic loss was es-\ntimated to be around 650 million USD, including 800,000 tons of ricecompletely lost.In addition, the lives of 17 million VMD inhabitants\nwere adversely affected.In 2020, the VMD experienced yet another cat-\nastrophic drought which possibly surpasses any historical records, in-\ncluding the ones observed in 2016 (From the local news: https://vtv.vn)."", 'Vietnam Academy of\nWater Research, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development, Hanoi, Vietnam(in Vietnamese).Torrence, C., Compo, G.P., 1998.A practical guide to wavelet analysis.Bull.Am.Meteorol.Soc.79 (1), 61 –78.Triet, N.V.K., Nguyen, V.D., Fujii, H., Kummu, M., Merz, B., Apel, H., 2017.Has dyke devel-\nop\nment in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta shifted ﬂood hazard downstream?Hydrol.Earth Syst.Sci.21, 3991.Trung, N.H., Thanh, V.Q., 2013.Vulnerability to ﬂood in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta:\nmapping and uncertainty assessment.J.

Based on the report, how has the increase in dams in the Mekong basin affected the dry season water level in the Mekong Delta?	The increase in dams in the Mekong basin has not been able to maintain the water level in the Mekong Delta during the dry season. Despite a 33% increase in dry season discharge at Kratie from 2009 to 2015, when 64 dams were completed, the water level in the Mekong Delta during the dry season is still expected to continue decreasing. This is due to factors such as reservoir sediment trapping and sand mining, which cause riverbed incision and make it difficult to maintain high levels of discharge from the dams.	"[""Mekong River will need to increase by more than 50% by dams' water\nrelease to maintain the water level unchanged. While riverbeds are con-\ntinuously incised due to reservoir sediment trapping and sand mining(Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020a ), that high level of discharge re-\nlease from upstream dams is not always possible. In fact, Binh et al.\n(2020c) found that the mean dry season discharge (i.e. in January –May) at Kratie increased by only 33% in 2009 –2015 (when 64 dams\nwere completed in the Mekong basin) from the pre-dam period(1980 –1992). Consequently, the dry season water level in the VMD is\nexpected to continue decreasing. Fig. 1 B shows signi ﬁcant riverbed inci-\nsion along the entire Tien and Hau River from 1998 to 2008, averaged bytwo to three meters. Binh et al. (2020a) found that the annual river bed\nFig. 1.

What are the combined effects that have led to the increasing trends of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam since the 1990s?	The increasing trends of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam have been caused by a combination of factors. These include riverbed incision, which is due to both riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence. The riverbed incision can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the salinity intrusion. Additionally, there has been a significant increase in tidal amplification, up to 66%, which has been revealed through the spectral analysis of the hourly water level data. This trend was further validated through the changes in slopes of the rating curves at the tidal zones, implying the relationships between the shift of the backwater effects on the rivers in the Mekong Delta and the lowered water levels.

Based on the report, how has the increase in sand mining activities around My Thuan station affected the tidal amplitudes and water levels in the Tien river?	The increase in sand mining activities around My Thuan station has led to a significant rise in tidal amplitudes and a decrease in water levels in the Tien river. The sand mining rate around My Thuan station was much higher, at 8 million tons per year, compared to other areas. This has resulted in greater drops in the water levels of the Tien river, leading to stronger bedload water exchange and the intensification of tidal signals. Specifically, the 12-hour frequency tidal amplitude at My Thuan station increased by 66%. This is substantially higher than the 20% increase observed at coastal areas.	"[""incision volume in 2014 –2017 from Tan Chau to My Thuan in the Tien\nRiver (52.5 Mm3/year) was nearly three times greater than that in\n1998 –2008 in the entire Tien and Hau Rivers (20 Mm3/year). They\nclaimed that the increased riverbed incision was caused by upstream\ndams (85%) and sand mining (15%). The increasing riverbed incision be-\ntween 1998 and 2008 and 2014 –2017 periods were consistent with the\nrapidly decreased water level at Tan Chau and Chau Doc in post-2011\ncompared to pre-2011 ( Fig. 2 A–B). Additionally, increasing riverbank\nerosion ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Jordan et al., 2019 ) may contribute to\nwater level reduction at riverine stations because of the expansion of\nthe cross-sectional area.\nOn the other hand, the mean annual water levels (calculated from\nthe hourly water level data) at three tidal stations along the coastline:\nBen Trai, My Thanh, and Binh Dai all presented signi ﬁcant increasing\ntrends since the 1990s ( p-value < 0.001) ( Fig. 2 D–F). In particular, the\nmean annual water levels at Ben Trai, My Thanh, and Binh Dai had re-\nspectively increased by approximately 0.072, 0,22 and 0.25 m during\nthe 20-year period from 1990 to 2010. This directly shows the amplify-\ning trend of SLR around VMD which is in line with the ﬁnding by Nhan\n(2016) . The increasing trends of SI across VMD are therefore attributed\nto the combined effects of decreased riverine water levels and increased\ntidal effects. In the following subsections, we further investigate how\nﬂuvial and tidal regimes have shifted in recent decades by analyzing\nthe power spectrum of the water level series.3.2. Ampli ﬁcation of tidal signals\n3.2.1. Power spectral analysis of the tidal effects\nThe estuaries of the Tien and Hau rivers are dominated by semi-\ndiurnal tides which have two troughs and two peaks daily (12- and24-hour oscillations in Fig. 3 A–F). On a monthly basis, the spring tide\nand neap tide, each occurs twice a month (half-month and one-month\noscillations in Fig. 3 A–F). Under pristine condition, these temporal fre-\nquencies and the respective amplitudes of the tidal regime should stayalmost unchanged. However, the results from our power spectral anal-\nysis show otherwise. More speci ﬁcally, the amplitudes of almost every\nspectral peak of the monthly tidal cycles had increased signi ﬁcantly\nafter 2000 periods at all river stations in our analysis ( Fig. 3 G–H). We\nspeculate that these unusual increases of the spectral peaks couldhave been attributed to the following: the increased tidal amplitude\n(in the continental shelf due to SLR) ( Nhan, 2016 ), drops in water levels\n(related to the riverbed mining and upstream dams) ( Park et al., 2020a ;\nPark et al., 2020b ), and LS ( Erban et al., 2014 ;Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).\nTable 2 further quanti ﬁes the shifts in the power spectral peaks at all\nthree analyzed stations. More speci ﬁcally, the power spectral density of\ntheﬂuvial oscillation (1 year monsoonal-seasonality) has decreased the\nmost at Hoa Binh (from 3.8 dB to −10.6 dB), followed by My Thuan\n(from−11\ndB to −12.5 dB) and Dai Ngai (from −11.1 dB to\n−11.6 dB). As the tidal regime interacts with the Mekong River's\nFig. 3. Tidal power spectrum analysis for three representative stations: My Thuan (A, B, G); Hoa Binh (C, D, H); and Dai Ngai (E, F, I).

What are the factors contributing to the increase in salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and how does this affect the water levels and tidal waves in the region?	The factors contributing to the increase in salinity intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) include the accelerated construction of hydropower dams upstream, which have significantly modified the hydro-sedimentary regimes of the river. The operation of these dam reservoirs, combined with sea level rise, has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's shorelines. Internally in the VMD, there has been a constant decrease of flood frequency due to sand mining and dike construction. Extensive mining in the lower reach of the river has led to significant geomorphic impacts such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank erosion. Additionally, the region is experiencing land subsidence due to groundwater extraction. The intrusion of saline water is a major threat to agricultural production as it salinizes essential freshwater resources and degrades the soil.

During dry seasons, strong northwestward winds combined with flood tides and sea water can penetrate inland between 40 and 60 km from the estuaries on both east and west coasts of the delta.

What are the potential impacts of sea level rise and reduced Mekong River discharge on the increase of salinity intrusion length and concentration in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	If the sea level rises by 25–30 cm in 2050, the salinity intrusion length and salinity concentration are expected to increase by 10 km and 0.5 –2.5 g/l in places 15 km from the sea. If there is a combined effect of 20 cm sea level rise and 15% discharge reduction of the Mekong River in the mid-2030s, the salinity isoline of 2.5 g/l is likely to intrude further up-river by 10 km in the main rivers and by 20 km in the paddy field. The respective numbers would be 20 km and 35 km if sea level rise of 45 cm combines with 29% discharge reduction of the Mekong River in the mid-2090s. If there was no emergency water release from dams in the 2015 –2016 drought event, salinity concentration in places 30 km from the sea will increase by 14 –23% if the discharge entering the Mekong Delta decreases by 364 m3/s from March 27 to April 27, 2016. The value will be 35 –51% if such discharge reduction combines with a 3.36 cm sea level rise. In this combined scenario, the salinity intrusion length may increase by 16 –24 km in the mainstream.

In a different manner, Mai et al.(2018a) exam-\nined what would happen if there was no emergency water release fromdams in the 2015 –2016 drought event.They revealed that salinity con-\ncentration in places 30 km from the sea will increase by 14 –23% if the\ndischarge entering the VMD decreases by 364 m\n3/s from March 27 to\nApril 27, 2016.The value will be 35 –51% if such discharge reduction\ncombines with a 3.36 cm SLR.In this combined scenario, the SI lengthmay increase by 16 –24 km in the mainstream.Another important driver\nof the recently enhanced SI in the VMD is the increasing construction ofhydraulic structures in the estuaries (i.e.salinity control sluice gates\nalong the main rivers).Surprisingly, the purpose of these hydraulic\nstructures is to control SI but Binh et al.(2020c) numerically found\nthat the construction of salinity control sluice gates along Tien andHau Rivers may enhance the length of SI up-river because of reducing\nbuffering zones near the estuaries.4.Management outlooks and policy implications\n4.1.The need to decouple the contributing factors to the SI: a budgetary\napproach\nThe results presented above have clari ﬁed how the dynamics of\nwater level balance between river and coastal can control the level ofSI in the VMD.The tug of war between salt and freshwater is deter-\nmined by a combined effect of riverbed mining, upstream hydropower\ndams, SLR, and LS.These drivers are recognized at different geographical\nscales; likewise, their respective countermeasures.For instance, while\nriverbed mining or LS can be entirely managed domestically, the opera-\ntion of the upstream dams can only be negotiated via transnational dip-\nlomatic measures.It is therefore critical to understand the roles of each\ndriver to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, hence effectively prioritizing the coun-\ntermeasures.In addition, the limited ﬁnancial and technical resources of\na developing country such as Vietnam critically urge the need to rankthe relative importance of the drivers to plan the mitigation strategies\naccordingly.In fact, a synthesized appreciation of the Mekong River\nbasin from the geomorphology and sedimentary perspectives, such as\nin the neighboring Chao Phraya basin (e.g.Park et al., 2020b ) is impor-\ntant, yet essentially lacking.Besides, the current understanding of SI in the VMD has been the-\nmatically fragmented so far, including for instance, tidal ampli ﬁcations\n(Eslami et al., 2019 ), riverbed mining and bank erosion ( Hackney\net al., 2020 ), or LS ( Minderhoud et al., 2017, 2018 ).The imbalance\ncould have been related to each research teams' technical backgrounds\nand expertise but mainly due to the challenge to separate the com-\npound effects on SI from different pressures.""]"
"""What is the method proposed in the report to estimate the level of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how does it relate to riverbed mining and upstream dams?"""	The report proposes a conceptual approach to estimate the relative contributions to saline intrusion from upstream hydropower dams and riverbed mining. It suggests that the incision rates (IRs) caused by these factors can vary significantly. For instance, the IRs from dams could range from 15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year. The report also considers riverbed mining to be the most likely underestimated factor due to the generalization of the IR across the Mekong Delta using values from local-scale surveys and the crude characterization of bathymetry. Advanced bathymetry survey methods could provide more accurate estimations, but they are not feasible due to time and cost constraints. Therefore, the report proposes this approach as a groundwork for future research. The report also emphasizes that mitigating saline water intrusion should first focus on strategies to slow down the IR from riverbed mining by controlling sediment excavation volumes.	"[""exclusively associated with the reach of the Mekong with the highest\nriverbed mining risks, i.e.Tan Chau to My Thuan.Accordingly, we spec-\nulated that the IR caused from dams would also vary, ranging from\n15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020b ).For SLR and LS, we refer to the previously published results, respectivelyreporting the IRs of 1.5 –2 cm/year and 0.82 cm/year ( Eslami et al., 2019 ;\nMinderhoud et al., 2017 ).Among the estimated IRs, we consider that\nthe riverbed mining is the most likely to be underestimated.This isdue to the generalization of the IR across the VMD using the values\ndriven from local-scale survey, and the crude characterization of ba-\nthymetry in the VMD, which is based on extrapolation of the single\nbeam echosounder ( Binh et al., 2020b ).Admittedly, advanced bathym-\netry survey methods such as multibeam echosounder (MBES) mighthave resulted in more accurate estimations of riverbend incision rates.However, covering the world's third largest delta using MBES would\nnot be feasible in terms of time and cost.Plus, given the absence of\nother viable alternatives, what we propose here could lay an important\ngroundwork that can inspire following up research for improvements\nfrom the relevant scienti ﬁc community.The resulting IRs, estimation\nmethods, and the key references are summarized in Table 3 .4.2.Policy outlooks - the need for both integrated and adaptive approaches\n4.2.1.Evidence-based priority of countermeasures\nAccording to our initial assessment on IRs presented in Table 3 ,t h e\nupstream dams have the most signi ﬁcant impact, followed by the river-\nbed mining, SLR and LS, constituting an evidence-based priority for\ndealing with the SI intensifying drivers.However, the major discrepan-\ncies in politics, philosophies and economic interests among the coun-\ntries sharing the Mekong River water resources ( Kansal et al., 2019 )\nwould make negotiating over the hydropower dams with the upstreamcountries an uphill battle for the Vietnam government.In contrast, the\nthree domestic issues should be more immediately manageable with\nregulatory and enforcement measures at different administration levels.Accordingly, with a speci ﬁc consideration of the three domestic pres-\nsures contributing to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, riverbed mining has the\nhighest IRs and substantially higher than those of SLR and LS.It is there-\nfore underlined that mitigating the intrusion of saline water in the VMD\nshould ﬁrst work on strategies to slow down the IR contributing from\nriverbed mining by controlling the sediment excavation volumes.Thiscall for bold, nation-wide actions to decisively control the exports of\nthe riverbed sediments while raising the disciplinary actions against il-\nlegal mining to effectively halt the sinking rate of the delta and safe-\nguard the livelihood of millions of inhabitants.4.2.2.Encouraging eco-based livelihoods for better adaptations\nLivelihood adaptation to salinity intrusion is another key aspect for\npolicy reforms.Our study has indicated how the saline water protrudes\nfurther inland and on a more frequent basis.Other studies have already\nshown how SI and other environmental pressures put millions of inhab-\nitants at critical risks ( Park et al., 2020a ;Park et al., 2020b ;Tamura et al.,\n2020 ;Loc et al., 2020a, 2020b ;Pham et al., 2020 ).Active adaptation to\nsalinity intrusion and living with salinity has also been put on the policy\nagenda with the Mekong Delta Plan (2013) , Resolution 120 in 2017.Moreover, agricultural models are increasingly adopted that thrive onsalinity intrusion.Basically, there are two options.Either farmersadapt their cropping to the wet-dry seasonality and grow a brackish\ncrop during the dry season ( Loc et al., 2017, 2018, 2020a, 2020b ;Tan\net al., 2020 ;Pham et al., 2020 ).The rice-shrimp system is well adapted\nto the regular rain-dry season spell, where a decent crop of rice can be\nharvested during the wet season, followed by the raising of an extensivecrop\nof shrimp."", 'Therefore, this scope of this paper expands into intro-\nducing a conceptual approach to estimate the relative contributions\nto SI from upstream hydropower dams and riverbed mining.Finally,\nbased on the novel biophysical evidence presented, we recommend\npotential measures for the VMD policy makers to deal with the\never-intensifying intrusion of saline water, incorporating both tech-n i c a la n dp o l i t i c a la s p e c t s .H.H.Loc, D.

What are the main drivers intensifying saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta and what strategies are suggested to mitigate this issue?	The main drivers intensifying saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta are riverbed incision, which is due to both riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence. The study suggests that it is crucial not to underestimate the impacts from these localized factors, especially riverbed-mining, which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the salinity intrusion. To mitigate this issue, the study recommends political reform based on these new findings.

While the existing literature pre dominantly points the cause of drought to the hydro-\npower dams in the upstream of the Mekong Basin , we contribute new physical evidence of the\nintensi ﬁcation of saline water intrusion (through backwater effect) in the VMD caused by three anthropo-\ngenic drivers: riverbed incision (due to both riverbed m ining and dam construction), sea level rise and land\nsubsidence. Thereupon, we highlight that it is critical to not underestimate the impacts from the localized\nfactors, especially the riverbed-mining which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the\nsalinity intrusion. Our analysis is based on the extensive sets of hourly-to-daily hydrological time series\nfrom 11 gauge stations across the VMD. First, several signs of signi ﬁcantly increased tidal ampliﬁ cation\n(up to 66%) were revealed through the spectral analysi s of the hourly water level data.

What are some potential crops or aquaculture that could be grown in areas with year-round exposure to saline water in the Mekong Delta, according to the report?	Farmers in areas with year-round exposure to saline water in the Mekong Delta could consider growing short-season vegetable crops that can be grown with limited fresh water, such as beans, spinach, and onions. They could also explore salt-tolerant fruticulture, such as coconut and pineapple, or brackish aquaculture supported with water infrastructure. Another option is the mangrove-shrimp ecosystem-based model, which involves cultivating economically valued black tiger giant shrimp in mangrove forests.	['Instead of shrimp, farmers could grow a short-season\nvegetable crop that can be grown with the limited fresh water available,\nsuch as beans, spinach, and onions.Another option worth exploring is the salt-tolerant fruticulture (e.g.coconut, pineapple) or brackish aquaculture that is supported with\nwater infrastructure (e.g.separate intake-outtake channels, daily\nrefreshing, use of bio ﬁlters, no groundwater pumping).This is particu-\nlarly important for those areas with year-round exposure to salinewater.Finally, an ecosystem-based model that has shown various\npromising merits while being adopted to the SI prone coastal areas is\nthe mangrove-shrimp ( Nguyen et al., 2020a ).This ecosystem-based\nmodel was built upon the community involvement whereby thefarmers are supported both in terms of ﬁnance and technical know-\nhows to cultivate economically valued (the black tiger giant shrimp)in the mangrove forests.Thereupon, the farmers proactively protect\nthe mangrove forests as their own properties, which in turn, safeguards\nanother important ecosystem service being the protection from storm\nsurges.4.2.3.Transboundary water diplomacy\nEven though the upstream dams pose the most challenging barrier\nto the SI that the VMD currently faces, there are potential pathways to\novercome.The key focus is how to effectively negotiate the co-shared\nwater resources with the competing upstream users, those whose ben-\neﬁts are directly/indirectly related to the hydropower dams.Theoreti-\ncally, this can be done via multinational diplomatic platforms namely,\nthe Mekong River Commission (MRC), the Greater Mekong Subregion\n(GMS) Program, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).However, they have not been as productive as intended due to multiple\ndiscrepancies between the member countries in terms of political/eco-\nnomic interests ( Kansal et al., 2019 ).Plus, not all geographically related\ncountries are keen on multilateral dialogues, instead, they opt for bilat-eral diplomacies, making the unanimity in sharing the resources within\nthe Mekong River Basin even harder to achieve ( Kuenzer and Renaud,\n2012 ).Nevertheless, it is strongly emphasized that the issues of the up-\nstream dams should be constantly discussed at regional and interna-\ntional forums so that the negative impacts of these structures on the\nbasin environment, including the intensi ﬁed salinity can be widely ac-\nknowledged.In doing so, the VMD stakeholders can generate supportfrom the international community, essential for the transboundary\nwater diplomacy plan.5.Conclusions\nThis paper advances the current understanding of SI in the VMD,\nhighlighting the signi ﬁcant recent shifts of the BWE imposed on the riv-\ners.This BWE is driven by four main environmental pressures: riverbed\nincision due to riverbed mining and dam construction, SLR and LS.Our\nanalysis is based on the extensive data sets of hydrological time series\nfrom 11 gauge stations across the VMD, along with ﬁeld survey bathym-\netry data.Table 3\nRiverbed incision rates (IRs) from different drivers.Rank Drivers Rate (cm/year) Estimation method References\n1 Upstream dams 15.6 –45.6 IRtotal−IRriverbed mining Brunier et al.(2014)Binh et al.(2020b)\n2 Riverbed mining 4.4 –15 V\nmined / Area water surface Jordan et al.(2019)Erban et al.(2014)\n3 Sea level rise 1.5 –2 Literature Eslami et al.(2019)\n4 Land subsidence 0–0.82 Literature Minderhoud et al.(2017)H.H.Loc, D.

What are the main drivers of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how are they affecting the water levels and salinity of the region?	The main drivers of salinity intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) are the accelerated construction of hydropower dams upstream, sea level rise, and internal factors such as sand mining, dike construction, and groundwater extraction. The operation of these dams has significantly modified the hydro-sedimentary regimes of the river. Combined with sea level rise, this has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's shorelines. Internally, the constant decrease of flood frequency due to sand mining and dike construction, as well as significant geomorphic impacts due to extensive mining in the lower reach of the river, such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank erosion, have contributed to the problem. Groundwater extraction has led to land subsidence at an alarming rate. These factors have led to the intrusion of saline water, which salinizes essential freshwater resources and degrades the soil. This intrusion disrupts the supply of freshwater for both domestic and industrial consumers, especially in coastal areas.

While the existing literature pre dominantly points the cause of drought to the hydro-\npower dams in the upstream of the Mekong Basin , we contribute new physical evidence of the\nintensi ﬁcation of saline water intrusion (through backwater effect) in the VMD caused by three anthropo-\ngenic drivers: riverbed incision (due to both riverbed m ining and dam construction), sea level rise and land\nsubsidence. Thereupon, we highlight that it is critical to not underestimate the impacts from the localized\nfactors, especially the riverbed-mining which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the\nsalinity intrusion.

What are the impacts of groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sea-level rise on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam due to climate change?	"Groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sea-level rise due to climate change have significant impacts on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. These factors contribute to the intensification of saline water intrusion and drought, which can threaten the long-term sustainability of the region. They also lead to a dramatic decrease in flood frequency due to river-bed mining and dyke construction. Furthermore, these changes can cause land-use dynamics to shift, affecting livelihood sustainability. The region's prawn-rice rotational crops may also become inefficient. Additionally, the Mekong Delta, often referred to as Vietnam's ""food basket"", is at risk due to land subsidence. Lastly, these factors contribute to the ongoing shrinkage of the Mekong megadelta."

What are the potential impacts of upstream hydropower dams and climate change on the hydrodynamics of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and its effects on irrigation water availability for rice cropping?	Upstream hydropower dams and climate change can significantly impact the hydrodynamics of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. These factors can increase the sensitivity of salinity intrusion, which is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers. This can have serious implications for the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping. The increased salinity can make the water unsuitable for irrigation, thereby affecting rice production. Additionally, the operation of dams and sea level rise can further exacerbate saltwater intrusion into the Mekong Delta.

What are the potential impacts of long-term sediment decline and rising sea levels on the sustainability of farming systems in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	The potential impacts of long-term sediment decline and rising sea levels on the sustainability of farming systems in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam include increased salinity intrusion, which can affect the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping. This can lead to changes in hydrodynamics and potentially impact the willingness of farm households to pay for risk reduction measures against salinity intrusion. Additionally, the decline in sediment can lead to land subsidence, further exacerbating the effects of sea-level rise. These changes can pose significant challenges to the long-term sustainability of farming systems in the region.

What are the potential impacts of climate change on flood propagation in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta?	The potential impacts of climate change on flood propagation in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta include increased flood hazards, vulnerability, and risk. This is due to factors such as intensifying saline water intrusion, drought, and changes in hydrodynamics. Additionally, sea-level rise and changes in river flow can increase the sensitivity of salinity intrusion, impacting the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping. The construction of upstream hydropower dams can also affect the hydrodynamics of the region. Furthermore, climate change can lead to groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sea-level rise, which can exacerbate flooding in the Mekong Delta.

Based on the report, what are the causes and potential impacts of salinity intrusion in the groundwater resources of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	"The salinity intrusion in the groundwater resources of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam is primarily caused by heavy overexploitation of groundwater. This overuse leads to a decrease in hydraulic heads, which increases the potential for seawater intrusion. The most significant environmental impact associated with this is the degradation of groundwater quality, which can limit its use and affect human health. Additionally, the overexploitation of groundwater can lead to local land subsidence of several centimeters a year due to decreased pore pressure from pumping. This results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. Combined with other factors such as natural compaction of sediment layers, decline of fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change, the low-lying Mekong Delta is threatened in its very existence. The problems can be summarized as a progressive ""loss of land and freshwater"", which could eventually lead to the inundation of large parts of the delta."

What are the potential impacts of groundwater overexploitation, including the risk of seawater intrusion, on the quality of groundwater and human health in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Overexploitation of groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, can lead to several negative environmental impacts. One of the most prominent is the decrease of hydraulic heads, which increases the potential for seawater intrusion. This intrusion can substantially degrade the quality of groundwater, limiting its use for various purposes. Moreover, the degraded water quality can also negatively impact human health. Additionally, overexploitation can cause severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, due to decreased pore pressure from pumping. This results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. These issues, combined with other factors such as natural compaction of sediment layers, decline of fluvial sediment supply, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to climate change, can lead to a progressive loss of land and freshwater. This could eventually result in the inundation of large parts of the delta.

What are the potential impacts of direct seawater intrusion on the groundwater system in the Ca Mau Peninsula, the southernmost province in Vietnam, and how might it affect the salinization rates in the region?	Direct seawater intrusion into the groundwater system in the Ca Mau Peninsula could substantially degrade groundwater quality and limit its use. This could also have negative effects on human health. The salinization rates in the region could increase due to the intrusion of seawater. Additionally, the overexploitation of groundwater could lead to a decrease in hydraulic heads, further increasing the potential for seawater intrusion. This could also lead to severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, resulting in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers.

How has the decline in hydraulic pressure heads in the main production aquifers in the Mekong Delta, particularly in populated areas like CMC, affected the natural groundwater flow and potentially contributed to salinity intrusion?	The decline in hydraulic pressure heads in the main production aquifers in the Mekong Delta, particularly in populated areas like CMC, has led to several negative environmental impacts. One of the most prominent impacts is the potential for seawater intrusion. This could substantially degrade groundwater quality and limit its use. The decrease in hydraulic heads could also affect human health. Additionally, the overexploitation of groundwater can lead to local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping. This results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What is the significance of molar ion ratios in distinguishing between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers?	Molar ion ratios, specifically Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl- and Mg2+/Cl- ratios, are useful tools for distinguishing between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. These ratios can help identify the signs of salinization, even in the early stages at low Cl- concentrations. For instance, a Na+/Cl- molar ratio above the seawater ratio of 0.86 in most samples indicates freshwater intrusion. On the other hand, samples with ratios lower than the seawater ratio may indicate seawater intrusion. These ratios can also reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with salinization and freshening.	['However, especially in redox-sensitive \nmarine and coastal settings, the difference between total alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity may not be neglected due to the \nimpact of other buffering bases such as B(OH) 4-, NH3, Si(OH) 3 O-, or F- (Lukawska-Matuszewska, 2016 ).The conversion factor for EC to TDS is highly depended on ionic water composition and may differ from the instrument value, \nwhich is typically calibrated by KCl solution (Vengosh, 2013 ).Therefore, TDS was calculated for each sample using the software \nGeochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC) with the whole elemental composition as input data.Furthermore, the \ndirect relationship between all parameters was calculated using pairwise Spearman correlation.The calcium carbonate system in coastal groundwater settings is complex, and many processes actually lead to carbonate disso -\nlution with subsequent increase in HCO 3- and Ca2+(Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).In saline aquifers, mixing of calcium carbonate \nsaturated fresh groundwater with seawater, which is typically oversaturated, produces brackish water which is undersaturated with \nregard to calcium carbonate due to the reduction in ionic strength, leading to calcite dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).The saturation indices for calcite (SIcalcite) were calculated using Geochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC).Furthermore, SI of additional evaporites including aragonite, dolomite, gypsum, sylvite and halite were calculated.The proportion of major cations Na++K+, Ca2+and Mg2+and anions HCO 3-, Cl- and SO42- were calculated and displayed in a Piper \nDiagram (Piper, 1944 ).The water type can be derived from the upper diamond shape (Back and Hanshaw, 1965 ).Water type analysis \ncan help to distinguish geochemical processes and to derive the origin of solutes.However, divisions and percentages used for clas-\nsification should be selected as to best fit the characteristics of the investigated water (Freeze and Cherry, 1979 ).Therefore, to achieve \na more detailed water type specification and to get more insights on mixed water types, the typical description was customized in order \nto more accurately display different states of salinization with an emphasis on cation-exchange processes.Proportions of major ions \nwere calculated and if only one cation or anion was above 33.3%, it is written alone, like Na-Cl water type, while if two ions were above \n33.3%, the ion with the higher proportion was written first, followed by the second ion in brackets, for example Na-Cl-(HCO 3).A mixed \nwater type is thus only defined if all three anions or cations have an equal share of around 33.3%, e.g.Na-Ca-Mg-Cl is written as Mix-Cl.2.2.3.Salinization and freshening \nThe evaluation of molar ion ratios is an appropriate tool to distinguish between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal \naquifers (Appelo, 1994; Jones et al., 1999; Russak et al., 2016 ).Therefore, Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl- and Mg2+/Cl- molar ratios were \ncalculated and compared to the conservative mixing line.Generally, salinization of a freshwater aquifer by seawater intrusion proceeds J. Bauer et al.', 'Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n12CMP where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low (Kim et al., 2017; Chapelle and McMahon, 1991 ).Overall, this is an \nimportant finding, demonstrating that the increase of EC values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater \nintrusion, but can also be attributed to the generation of additional HCO 3-.4.2.Salinization and freshening processes \nCoastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion, \nrespectively (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Han et al., 2020 ).Fig.8 reveals that the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the \nstudy area is well above the seawater ratio of 0.86.Only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater.It is remarkable that the water \ntype of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing Cl- concentration from Mix-Cl-(HCO 3) and \nCa-Cl-(HCO 3) over Na-Mg-Cl and finally to Na-Cl, while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) \ntype.This observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and \nfreshening.The customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with \nsalinization.It can be observed that Na-Mg-Cl seem to occur at higher Cl- concentrations compared to Ca-Cl-(HCO 3) (see Fig.8), \nprobably because seawater contains more Mg2+over Ca2+with a Mg2+/Ca2+ratio of 4.5–5.2 (Vengosh, 2013 ).The Mg2+/Cl- ratio is \nshown in Fig.9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest Na+/Cl- ratios and salinization water types, again demonstrating the \ncation-exchange processes.The same pattern can be observed for Ca2+/Cl- (Fig.10) but with a wider spread and deviation from the \nmixing line, as Ca2+concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution, which in turn \ndepend on HCO 3- concentrations.In conclusion, freshwater intrusion is, or was, the predominant process leading to the abundant Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) type \ngroundwater in CMP.The rarely occurring groundwater of Na-Cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, where Cl- is still the dominant anion.Further freshening produces waters of Na-HCO 3 type and Cl- below 25mg/L, as found \nin the northeast of the study area.Due to the general hydrogeological conditions, it can also be assumed that the freshening process has \nprogressed furthest in this region.This assumption is supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- \nbetween 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east (Fig.7).It can be expected that both processes, cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decompo -\nsition, contribute to observed Na-HCO 3 groundwater in CMP.Detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of Na+/ \nCl- molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization, \neven in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.Focusing on total salinity via EC analysis alone, however, is not a suitable method.For \nexample, three samples in the central north (Fig.5c) have EC values below 1000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).However, based on their Na+/Cl- \nratio, which is below the seawater line (Fig.7), and their water type (Fig.3), particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of \nsalinization.4.3.Groundwater evolution and development \nMarine transgression and regression phases in the Quaternary (Fig.']
What happens to the groundwater during the process of salinization and freshening in terms of the exchange of cations like Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+?	During the process of salinization, fresh groundwater that is dominated by Ca2+ becomes enriched in Na+ and Mg2+. Divalent cations are generally exchanged on the mineral surface preferentially to monovalent cations. However, as salinization intensifies, this ion selectivity is masked by the proportional increase in sorption with increasing concentration, especially of the monovalent ion Na+. As salinization continues, Na+ exchanges divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ from sedimentary rocks, forming Ca-Cl and Na-Mg-Cl waters. The overall salinity increases, and the proportion of divalent cations also increases.On the other hand, the process of freshening, which is the inflow of freshwater into saline coastal aquifers, reverses the cation-exchange reaction. When freshwater of Ca-HCO3 type intrudes the saline aquifer, exchangeable Na+ on mineral surfaces, especially clay minerals, is substituted by Ca2+ and Mg2+, due to a higher sorption selectivity. This changes the water type to the characteristic Na-HCO3. The Na+/Cl- ratio increases above the level of seawater, while Ca2+ as well as Mg2+ become depleted.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n6in the following steps (Appelo and Postma, 2004; Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999; Vengosh, 2013 ): In the early \nstages of salinization, fresh Ca2+-dominated groundwater is enriched in Na+and Mg2+. In general, divalent cations are exchanged on \nthe mineral surface preferentially to monovalent cations (Carroll, 1959; Steudel and Emmerich, 2013 ). However, at a certain intensity \nof salinization ion selectivity is masked by the proportional increase in sorption with increasing concentration, especially of the \nmonovalent ion Na+(Sawhney, 1972 ). In conclusion, during further salinization Na+exchanges divalent cations Ca2+and Mg2+from \nsedimentary rocks forming Ca-Cl and Na-Mg-Cl waters. Simultaneously, overall salinity increases, while also the proportion of divalent \ncations increases. \nConversely, freshwater inflow into saline coastal aquifers, also referred to as freshening, reverses the cation-exchange reaction \ncontrary to the salinization process (Appelo, 1994 ). When freshwater of Ca-HCO 3 type intrudes the saline aquifer exchangeable Na+on \nmineral surfaces, especially clay minerals, is substituted by Ca2+and Mg2+, due to a higher sorption selectivity, and the water type \nchanges to the characteristic Na-HCO 3. The Na+/Cl- ratio increases above the level of seawater, while Ca2+as well as Mg2+become \ndepleted (Appelo and Postma, 2004; Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999 ). \nIn the natural environment, Cl- often acts as a conservative tracer and ion ratios are commonly calculated relative to Cl- (Jones \net al., 1999 ). Sea water has a Na+/Cl- molar ratio of around 0.86. Due to the above-mentioned cation exchange reactions, Na+/Cl- \ndecreases below the conservative mixing line during salinization and increases during freshening. \n2.2.4. Hydrogeological model \nTo fully evaluate the fresh-saline groundwater patterns in the context of stratigraphy and depth, samples were assigned to their \nrespective aquifer based on available lithological information. As owners of private wells do not know their target aquifer and because \nno sufficient subsurface model was available for the region, a simplified hydrogeological model was constructed using lithological data \nfrom 27 borehole logs in CMP (Vuong, 2014 ), provided by the National Center for Water Resources Planning and Investigation \nVietnam (NAWAPI), whereas six of them are part of the national monitoring network. The locations of the boreholes are shown in  \nFig. 2. The model serves two purposes: (i) assignment of samples to an aquifer and hence (ii) visualization of samples in depth to \ndelineate aquifer dependent groundwater properties. A layer-based approach was chosen, where surfaces were created separately and \nFig. 2.Location of 27 boreholes (Vuong, 2014 ) and extent of the interpolation area (purple) used for the calculation of the hydrogeological model.  J. Bauer et al.', 'The freshening event \nhappened during the last marine regression phase 60–12 ka BP and especially during the LGM, 26 ka BP to 18 ka BP, and shows slightly \ndecreasing intensity from Pleistocene to Miocene aquifers.Element ratios of Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl-, as well as Mg2+/Cl- and their deviation \nfrom the seawater line were used to determine cation exchange processes between groundwater and aquifer sediments, and thus to \ncharacterize salinization and freshening processes.As demonstrated, evaluation of characteristic element rations is a powerful tool to \ndetermine groundwater state and evolution in coastal environments.This is particularly valid in contrast to the sole analysis of salinity \nvia EC measurements, which has not proven to be a suitable indicator of seawater intrusion.Moreover, hydrogeological layers in CMP are estimated to be connected, at least partly, either through natural discontinuities or \nanthropogenic influences.Even though the formation of impermeable aquitards in the Holocene marine transgression phase prevented \nextensive seawater intrusion, some samples show distinct salinization signatures of unknown origin.Salinization due to seawater \nintrusion would result in accelerated groundwater degradation.Therefore, it is important to distinguish direct seawater intrusion from \nmixing with other saline water sources, like the slow downwards migration due to unstable aquifer conditions, to establish a sus-\ntainable water management plan necessary to provide clean freshwater to the people.These findings have a direct implication to the \nwhole MD region.More work about the current state of salinization and freshening in the MD will be conducted using geochemical fingerprinting \nmethods like ion ratios, trace elements, stable isotope techniques and geochemical models.By considering the new insights on natural \ndrivers leading to the current groundwater composition in CMP presented in this study, the effect of pumping induced changes in \nhydraulic parameters and geochemistry can be appropriately evaluated in a future study, also considering pumping induced land \nsubsidence.Lastly, concepts for alternative water resources substituting groundwater should be considered and developed to mitigate \nnegative environmental impacts.J.

What does the spatial distribution map of HCO3-, Cl- and EC indicate about the geochemistry and evolution of groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta?	The spatial distribution map of HCO3-, Cl- and EC indicates that locations with elevated EC are randomly distributed across the region and are most often represented by more than one sample at each location from both Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers. This suggests that these locations are not a single well phenomenon but a local spatial pattern. This pattern also applies to other ions and ion ratios. The data suggests that aquifers are to some extent connected, either through natural discontinuities in the stratigraphy or hydrological short circuits caused by well leakage or well failure. There is no significant correlation between geochemical patterns and depth or aquifer, or the distance to the coast. Elevated levels of EC in the southern part of the study region cannot solely be attributed to Cl- associated with seawater but rather to the presence of high HCO3- concentrations. The source of HCO3- is not freshwater intrusion. High concentrations of HCO3- in the south of the study area cannot be explained by simple mixing and calcite dissolution.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n114.Discussion \n4.1.Groundwater composition \nThe shift of the fresh-saline water boundary further inland is a major concern for water management in CMP, as an increase of \nsalinity would significantly degrade groundwater resources and limit their use.40 out of 190 samples exceed the Vietnamese limit for \ntotal dissolved solids (TDS) of 1500 mg/L (MONRE, 2015 ), which is equivalent to an EC value of 1850 µS/cm (see chapter 3.1).47 \nsamples exceed the threshold for Cl- of 250mg/L.Thus, some groundwater is already unsuitable for direct drinking purpose.Data \ncollected in this study, however, also show that locations with elevated EC are randomly distributed across CMP and are most often \nrepresented by more than one sample at each location from both Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers.This leads to the conclusion that \nlocations of elevated EC are not a single well phenomenon but a local spatial pattern.This is also true for other ions and ion ratios, as \nshown in Figs.5 and 7.This indicates that aquifers are to some extend connected, at least partly, either through natural discontinuities \nin the stratigraphy, as also recently proposed by other authors (Doan et al., 2018; Pechstein et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2019 ), or hy-\ndrological short circuits caused by well leakage or well failure (Doan et al., 2018 ), which are rarely considered.In a regional \nperspective, no significant correlation between geochemical patterns and depth or aquifer was found, as shown by the correlation \nanalysis (Table A1 in appendix A) and by the geological cross section (Fig.6).In addition, locations with higher EC are not correlated to \nthe distance to the coast.As a simple and straightforward measure of salinity, EC is a useful parameter to characterize and classify groundwater resources in \ncoastal regions potentially affected by seawater intrusion, especially when detailed analysis is not available.Seawater of Na-Cl type is \nlargely uniform with a TDS of around 35g/L, while freshwater is often defined with a TDS concentration below 1g/L (Vengosh, 2013 ), \nmeaning that even slight seawater intrusion is detectable.However, groundwater composition is often more complex and other pa-\nrameters than Na+and Cl- are affecting EC as well (Jones et al., 1999 ).This also applies to data presented in this study.As shown in \nFig.5a-c, elevated levels of EC in the southern part of the study region cannot solely be attributed to Cl- associated with seawater but \nrather to the presence of high HCO 3- concentrations.In fact, around Nam Can groundwater with EC >2000 µS/cm is of Na-HCO 3 and \nNa-HCO 3-(Cl) type (Fig.3) and HCO 3- concentrations are lowest inland in the northeastern area, where recent freshwater inflow is \nestimated to occur, even though it might be limited (Fig.5a).This indicates that the source of HCO 3- is not freshwater intrusion.Almost \nall samples are oversaturated to calcite (n=158), especially in the south and central south between CMC and Nam Can (Fig.A5 in \nappendix A), which should lead to calcite precipitation.Only a few samples in the northern part of the study area are slightly un-\ndersaturated to calcite (n=5) or in equilibrium (n=27).One reason for the oversaturation of calcite might be the addition of Ca2+\ndue to cation exchange processes or the dissolution of gypsum (Plummer et al., 1990 ), which has a SI between \x001.56 and \x006.21.This \ncontradicts typical hydrochemical facies evolution in coastal areas, where SIcalcite tends to decrease towards the sea (Custodio and \nBruggerman, 1987 ).Ca2+and HCO 3- have a negative correlation and while HCO 3- concentrations increase, Ca2+concentrations are \nrelatively low, probably because Ca2+is involved in complex ion exchange processes (Jones et al., 1999 ).It is therefore concluded that \nobserved high concentrations of HCO 3- in the south of the study area cannot be explained by simple mixing and calcite dissolution.', 'Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n17Nguyen, V.L., Ta, T.K.O., Saito, Y., 2010.Early Holocene initiation of the Mekong River delta, Vietnam, and the response to Holocene sea-level changes detected from \nDT1 core analyses.Sediment.Geol.230, 146–155.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.07.006.Orem, W.H., Gaudette, H.E., 1984.Organic matter in anoxic marine pore water: oxidation effects.Org.Geochem.5, 175–181.https://doi.org/10.1016/0146-6380 \n(84)90003-2.Parker, A., 2020.Anthropogenic drivers of relative sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta - A Review.Quaest.Geogr.39, 109–124.https://doi.org/10.2478/quageo-2020- \n0009.Pechstein, A., Hanh, H.T., Orilski, J., Nam, L.H., Manh, L.

Pham et al., 2019 ).Saline groundwater prevails in the upper Holocene \nand late Pleistocene aquifer while fresh groundwater is unevenly distributed in Middle and Early Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Miocene \naquifers (Wagner et al., 2012 ).In order to determine the salinity levels and distribution in CMP, a total of 190 groundwater samples \nwere taken in five field campaigns between February 2017 and December 2019.As recent groundwater recharge in deep aquifers is \nnegligible due to several less permeable aquitards and the low hydraulic gradient (Anderson, 1978; Pham et al., 2019 ) it was estimated \nthat the time or season of sampling does not influence groundwater properties.The focus was on private household wells, but also \nsamples from school wells, drinking water production companies, administrative buildings and smaller businesses were taken.Sample \nlocations were randomly selected with the intention to cover the whole province.In addition, to cover the main production aquifers in \nCMP, wells of varying depth between 60m and 310m were chosen to represent the Middle Pleistocene qp2–3, Lower Pleistocene qp1, \nMiddle Pliocene n22 and Lower Pliocene n21 aquifer (see Table 1).Since all wells are constructed in a closed system including a tap and \na pump, construction details like well depth, diameter and year of construction rely on information given by the owner.Almost all \nprivate household wells are made of PVC with a diameter of 49mm and are screened a few meters in the target aquifer.Prior to sampling, standing water in the pipe was exchanged and the equipment was cleaned thoroughly with fresh groundwater at \neach location.Physiochemical parameters including temperature, pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were determined on site using a \nmulti-parameter portable meter (WTW Multi 3630 IDS).2.2.2.Groundwater composition \nGroundwater in coastal aquifers is often the result of mixing between seawater, both recent and paleo, and freshwater \n(Gim´enez-Forcada, 2010; Jones et al., 1999 ).The deviation from the conservative mixing line between the two endmembers seawater \nand freshwater due to cation exchange reactions between groundwater and aquifer sediments is one of the most remarkable phe-\nnomena in coastal groundwater geochemistry (Jones et al., 1999; Russak and Sivan, 2010 ).In order to gain deeper insights on the \ngeochemical composition and to derive these processes, a comprehensive analysis for cations and anions was conducted for each \nsample.For both analysis, 25ml of sample groundwater was separately filtered through a 0.45 µm cellulose-acetate filter (Satorius \nStedim Biotech GmbH).50µL of high-purity nitric acid was added to prevent cation precipitation (APHA, 2017 ) and microbiological \nprocesses were inhibited for accurate anion analysis by adding 50µL sodium azide (Vanderford et al., 2011 ).The groundwater samples \nwere transported to Germany and analyzed with ICP-MS (Thermo Fisher X-Series 2) for cations and Ion Chromatography (Dionex \nICS-1000 with column IonPac As14 Supressor ERS 500 and Methrom Compact IC 930 with column Metrosep A Supp 5–150.Eluent: \nNaHCO 3/Na(CO 3)2) for anions in the laboratory of the Institute of Applied Geosciences at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, \nGermany.Additionally, total alkalinity was determined by measuring the acid capacity to pH 8.2 and pH 4.3 with a titration test kit (Merck \nKGaA).Concentration of HCO 3- and CO32- were directly derived from the alkalinity results.']
Based on the report, how does the increase in salinity in the groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta affect their usability for direct drinking purposes?	The increase in salinity in the groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta can substantially degrade the quality of the groundwater, limiting its use for direct drinking purposes. This is due to the potential of seawater intrusion, which is a prominent negative environmental impact associated with groundwater overexploitation in the area. This degradation of groundwater quality can also have implications for human health.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What is the role of organic matter in increasing the concentration of HCO3- in coastal aquifers in the Mekong Delta?	Organic matter plays a significant role in increasing the concentration of HCO3- in coastal aquifers. When organic matter is oxidized, it turns into dissolved organic carbon, which can then become dissolved inorganic carbon. This process can lead to the production of HCO3-. In fact, the concentration of HCO3- resulting from the oxidation of organic matter can exceed the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times. Furthermore, the reduction of organic matter can shift the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in PCO2 and changes in pH, causing dissolution. High amounts of organic matter, due to their marine and estuarial origin, are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers in the Mekong Delta, which could account for high HCO3- concentrations. Additionally, sulfate reduction, which directly produces HCO3-, leads to sulfate depletion, a characteristic of freshening aquifers rich in organic matter.	['Another possible source of HCO 3- in coastal aquifers is dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter, which is oxidized to \ndissolved inorganic carbon.It was shown in other studies that the concentration of HCO 3- originating from organic matter oxidation \ncan surpass the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times (Chapelle and McMahon, 1991; Orem and \nGaudette, 1984 ).In addition, organic matter reduction also shifts the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in PCO2 as well as \nchanges in pH, and causes dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999 ).Due to their marine and estuarial origin, \nhigh amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers in CMP (Doan et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2010; \nPechstein et al., 2018 ) and could therefore account for high HCO 3- concentrations.Furthermore, sulfate reduction directly produces \nHCO 3- and leads to sulfate depletion, which is typical for freshening aquifers rich in organic matter and might therefore also apply to \nFig.8.Na+/Cl- plot of groundwater samples including water type markers associated with salinization of freshwater aquifers.J.

Based on the report, what are the signs of salinization in groundwater and how does it relate to seawater intrusion in coastal areas?	Signs of salinization in groundwater can be identified through detailed water type analysis, evaluation of Na+/Cl- molar ratios, and consideration of cation exchange processes. These methods can detect salinization even in its early stages at low Cl- concentrations. In coastal areas, salinization can occur due to seawater intrusion or mixing with other saline water sources. However, total salinity analysis via EC measurements alone is not a suitable method for detecting seawater intrusion. Some samples may show distinct salinization signatures of unknown origin, which could potentially be due to seawater intrusion, leading to accelerated groundwater degradation. Therefore, it's crucial to distinguish direct seawater intrusion from other sources of salinization to establish a sustainable water management plan.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n12CMP where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low (Kim et al., 2017; Chapelle and McMahon, 1991 ).Overall, this is an \nimportant finding, demonstrating that the increase of EC values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater \nintrusion, but can also be attributed to the generation of additional HCO 3-.4.2.Salinization and freshening processes \nCoastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion, \nrespectively (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Han et al., 2020 ).Fig.8 reveals that the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the \nstudy area is well above the seawater ratio of 0.86.Only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater.It is remarkable that the water \ntype of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing Cl- concentration from Mix-Cl-(HCO 3) and \nCa-Cl-(HCO 3) over Na-Mg-Cl and finally to Na-Cl, while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) \ntype.This observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and \nfreshening.The customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with \nsalinization.It can be observed that Na-Mg-Cl seem to occur at higher Cl- concentrations compared to Ca-Cl-(HCO 3) (see Fig.8), \nprobably because seawater contains more Mg2+over Ca2+with a Mg2+/Ca2+ratio of 4.5–5.2 (Vengosh, 2013 ).The Mg2+/Cl- ratio is \nshown in Fig.9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest Na+/Cl- ratios and salinization water types, again demonstrating the \ncation-exchange processes.The same pattern can be observed for Ca2+/Cl- (Fig.10) but with a wider spread and deviation from the \nmixing line, as Ca2+concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution, which in turn \ndepend on HCO 3- concentrations.In conclusion, freshwater intrusion is, or was, the predominant process leading to the abundant Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) type \ngroundwater in CMP.The rarely occurring groundwater of Na-Cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, where Cl- is still the dominant anion.Further freshening produces waters of Na-HCO 3 type and Cl- below 25mg/L, as found \nin the northeast of the study area.Due to the general hydrogeological conditions, it can also be assumed that the freshening process has \nprogressed furthest in this region.This assumption is supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- \nbetween 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east (Fig.7).It can be expected that both processes, cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decompo -\nsition, contribute to observed Na-HCO 3 groundwater in CMP.Detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of Na+/ \nCl- molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization, \neven in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.Focusing on total salinity via EC analysis alone, however, is not a suitable method.For \nexample, three samples in the central north (Fig.5c) have EC values below 1000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).However, based on their Na+/Cl- \nratio, which is below the seawater line (Fig.7), and their water type (Fig.3), particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of \nsalinization.4.3.Groundwater evolution and development \nMarine transgression and regression phases in the Quaternary (Fig.', 'The freshening event \nhappened during the last marine regression phase 60–12 ka BP and especially during the LGM, 26 ka BP to 18 ka BP, and shows slightly \ndecreasing intensity from Pleistocene to Miocene aquifers.Element ratios of Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl-, as well as Mg2+/Cl- and their deviation \nfrom the seawater line were used to determine cation exchange processes between groundwater and aquifer sediments, and thus to \ncharacterize salinization and freshening processes.As demonstrated, evaluation of characteristic element rations is a powerful tool to \ndetermine groundwater state and evolution in coastal environments.This is particularly valid in contrast to the sole analysis of salinity \nvia EC measurements, which has not proven to be a suitable indicator of seawater intrusion.Moreover, hydrogeological layers in CMP are estimated to be connected, at least partly, either through natural discontinuities or \nanthropogenic influences.Even though the formation of impermeable aquitards in the Holocene marine transgression phase prevented \nextensive seawater intrusion, some samples show distinct salinization signatures of unknown origin.Salinization due to seawater \nintrusion would result in accelerated groundwater degradation.Therefore, it is important to distinguish direct seawater intrusion from \nmixing with other saline water sources, like the slow downwards migration due to unstable aquifer conditions, to establish a sus-\ntainable water management plan necessary to provide clean freshwater to the people.These findings have a direct implication to the \nwhole MD region.More work about the current state of salinization and freshening in the MD will be conducted using geochemical fingerprinting \nmethods like ion ratios, trace elements, stable isotope techniques and geochemical models.By considering the new insights on natural \ndrivers leading to the current groundwater composition in CMP presented in this study, the effect of pumping induced changes in \nhydraulic parameters and geochemistry can be appropriately evaluated in a future study, also considering pumping induced land \nsubsidence.Lastly, concepts for alternative water resources substituting groundwater should be considered and developed to mitigate \nnegative environmental impacts.J.

Based on the report, how does the decrease in hydraulic heads in recent decades potentially contribute to the freshening of groundwater in the Mekong Delta?	The decrease in hydraulic heads due to overexploitation of groundwater in the Mekong Delta can lead to seawater intrusion. This intrusion can significantly degrade the quality of groundwater, limit its use, and potentially impact human health. Additionally, the decrease in hydraulic heads can cause severe local land subsidence, resulting in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This does not contribute to the freshening of groundwater, but rather, it poses a threat to the quality and availability of fresh groundwater in the region.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

"""What are the potential impacts of seawater intrusion on groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta, and how can these impacts be mitigated?"""	Seawater intrusion into groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta can lead to a significant degradation of groundwater quality, limiting its use and potentially affecting human health. This is primarily due to the overexploitation of groundwater, which decreases hydraulic heads and increases the potential for seawater intrusion. Additionally, the extraction of groundwater can lead to local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, resulting in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with other factors such as natural compaction of sediment layers, decline of fluvial sediment supply, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to climate change, can threaten the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. To mitigate these impacts, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development Strategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission have been put in place. These initiatives aim to address the aforementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and work towards a sustainable development of the Mekong Delta. Understanding the hydrogeological development of groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta is essential to forecasting future resource availability and implementing effective conservation strategies.

What are the potential impacts of decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise on the survival and sedimentation of the Mekong Delta, as mentioned in the report?	The potential impacts of decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise on the survival and sedimentation of the Mekong Delta include a decrease in hydraulic heads and the potential for seawater intrusion, which could degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and affect human health. Additionally, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with additive processes, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. Other impacts include natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change. Some parts of the Mekong Delta are also facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion. Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons leading to severe droughts, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise. Overall, these problems can lead to a progressive “loss of land and freshwater”, which could eventually result in the inundation of large parts of the delta.

Based on the provided context, what are some potential impacts of groundwater contamination in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	"Groundwater contamination in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, can lead to several negative impacts. One of the most prominent is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which could significantly degrade groundwater quality and limit its use. This could also affect human health. Additionally, overexploitation of groundwater can lead to severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, resulting in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with other processes, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. The problems can be summarized as a progressive ""loss of land and freshwater"", which could eventually lead to the inundation of large parts of the delta."	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What are the potential impacts of groundwater extraction and climate change on the salinity and overall health of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, according to the studies mentioned in the context?	Groundwater extraction and climate change can have significant impacts on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. Overexploitation of groundwater can lead to a decrease in hydraulic heads, which increases the potential for seawater intrusion. This could degrade the quality of groundwater, limit its use, and negatively affect human health. Additionally, the extraction process can cause local land subsidence of several centimeters per year, resulting in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, combined with natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, a decline in fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. Some areas of the Delta are also experiencing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion. Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonged dry seasons leading to severe droughts, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise. Overall, these problems can lead to a progressive loss of land and freshwater, which could eventually result in the inundation of large parts of the delta.

What are the anthropogenic drivers of relative sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta as mentioned in the context?	The anthropogenic drivers of relative sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta include heavy overexploitation of groundwater, which leads to various negative environmental impacts such as the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion. This overexploitation also results in severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping. This results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. Other drivers include a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change. Some parts of the Mekong Delta are also facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion. Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons leading to severe droughts, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater.

What are the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta, according to the studies mentioned in the context?	Climate change can have several impacts on groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta. One of the most prominent negative environmental impacts associated with groundwater overexploitation is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which could substantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and affect human health. Additionally, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with additive processes, threatens the low-lying Mekong Delta's very existence. Other factors include natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, a decline of fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change. Some parts of the Mekong Delta are also facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion. Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons leading to severe droughts, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise. Overall, these problems can lead to a progressive “loss of land and freshwater”, which could eventually result in the inundation of large parts of the delta.

"""What are the main causes of soil salinization and how does it affect agricultural production, particularly rice cultivation, in the Mekong Delta?"""	The main causes of soil salinization in the Mekong Delta, specifically in Hau Giang province, are seawater intrusion and salinized groundwater. This accumulation of soluble salts in the soil can negatively impact agricultural production by making productive land areas unsuitable for farming or reducing crop yield.

These include the use of suitable irrigation methods, planting salt-tolerant crop varieties, and applying lime (CaCO3). These strategies can help reduce the adverse effect of salinity, particularly in areas affected with a moderate level of total soluble salts.

What are the potential impacts of saltwater intrusion on agricultural production in coastal regions like the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, as mentioned in the context?	Saltwater intrusion can have severe impacts on agricultural production in coastal regions like the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. The intrusion of saltwater can lead to the deterioration of soil quality, making it difficult to cultivate crops such as rice paddies. The salinity of the water surface increases as seawater intrudes into the rivers, extending to significant distances from the coastline. This can draw the attention of both domestic and international private and public sectors, as well as scientists. The severity of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta is expected to increase in the dry season of 2023, further threatening the rice supply in the foreseeable future. Additionally, a method of spatially monitoring soil salinity in the Mekong River has been proposed to support the management of land resources and to determine the suitable crops to cultivate.

"""What are the impacts of saltwater intrusion and climate change on coastal agriculture, as discussed in the 2023 study by Tarolli et al.?"""	Saltwater intrusion and climate change pose significant threats to coastal agriculture. Changing climatic conditions, including sea-level rise and drought, are causing progressive land degradation, particularly in river deltas. This degradation negatively impacts the sustainable development of agriculture, society, and economy. Droughts are responsible for particularly severe saltwater intrusion events, as lack of rainfall leads to scarce river discharge and favors marine water inland flow intrusion. The consequences for agricultural production are numerous, including impaired plant uptake of water and essential nutrients, negative effects on crop growth and development, higher weed competition, lower soil microbial activity, and overall crop productivity reduction. The study also presents the case of two critical regions, the Po River Delta and the Mekong Delta, which are considered the world's hotspots of saltwater intrusion phenomenon.

"""What are the main factors contributing to saltwater intrusion in the Po River Delta and how has climate change exacerbated these factors?"""	The main factors contributing to saltwater intrusion in the Po River Delta include the pumping of groundwater, reduced river flow due to damming and irrigation, rising sea levels, and subsidence. Subsidence in this area, which occurred mainly in the 1950s and 60s, was caused by large extractions of methane from the subsoil. Climate change has significantly worsened these factors by leading to increasingly frequent arid conditions. This has resulted in more frequent and severe droughts, which lower the discharge of the Po River, favoring the intrusion of saltwater along the delta's tributaries. The reduced river flow and lack of precipitation during these drought periods have had severe impacts on the area's natural resources, including soil salinization, habitat loss, and reduced agricultural productivity.	['factors, including thepumping ofgroundwater, thereduced flow oftheriver duetodamming\nand irrigation, and rising sealevels. Another factor issubsidence; about 40,000 hectares ofthe\nPoRiver delta arebelow thesealevel (insome points, more than -3masl). Subsidence mainly\noccurred inthe1950s and 60s. Itwascaused byhuge extractions ofmethane from thesubsoil.\nClimate change hassignificantly worsened these factors, leading toincreasingly frequent arid\nconditions [5].This hasseverely impacted thearea’s natural resources, including soilsaliniza-\ntion, habitat loss, and reduced agricultural productivity (Fig 1).Inthelasttwodecades, sixepi-\nsodes ofdrought occurred. They were characterized bylowdischarge ofthePoRiver (below\n450m3s-1,acritical threshold indicated toguarantee theriver’s ecological functionality; the\naverage discharge oftheriver isabout 1500 m3s-1),favoring theintrusion ofsaltwater along\nthetributaries ofthedelta uptomany kilometers from thesea.Inallthese episodes, the\nrecorded water salinity wasmore than 2g/l,thecritical threshold FAO indicated forirrigation.\nOne ofthemost severe droughts ever recorded inEurope occurred in2022 summer [5].Itdra-\nmatically affected northern Italy through water shortages and other indirect processes. During\nthat period, much ofthesurface ofthePoRiver Delta wasexposed tosaltwater intrusion, with\nwater salinity peaks inJuly when thedischarge reached thenegative record of104m3s-1at\nFig1.Saltwater intrusion inthePoRiver Delta during thetwo major drought softhesummer of2006 and 2022.

What are the main factors driving the intrusion of saltwater in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, and how is it impacting the cultivation of rice paddies and soil quality in the area?	The main factors driving the intrusion of saltwater in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam include upstream hydropower dams, land subsidence, the relative sea-level rise, and riverbed sand mining. This saltwater intrusion has led to the deterioration of soil quality, making it difficult to cultivate rice paddies. The salinity of the water surface increases by approximately 4g/l as seawater intrudes into the Hau and Tien rivers, extending to 45–65 km and 55–60 km from the coastline, respectively.

How could climate change potentially affect the temperature and climate conditions in areas with a cold semi-arid climate, such as where rice is a major crop?	Climate change could potentially lead to higher temperatures in areas with a cold semi-arid climate, where rice is a major crop. This could result in the climate shifting to a hot semi-arid zone. There could also be an intensification in the frequency of heat waves, which could have potential impacts on agriculture.

Based on the context, what are the impacts of the worst saline water intrusion disaster in the Mekong Delta in 2020, and what are the implications for its management?	The worst saline water intrusion disaster in the Mekong Delta in 2020 led to the deterioration of soil quality, making it difficult to cultivate rice paddies. The salinity of the water surface increased as seawater intruded into the Hau and Tien rivers, extending to 45–65 km and 55–60 km from the coastline, respectively. This situation has drawn significant attention from domestic and international private and public sectors and scientists. A method of spatially monitoring soil salinity in the Mekong River has been proposed using satellite data-derived variables to support land resource management and determine suitable crops to cultivate. The severity of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta is expected to increase in the dry season of 2023, further threatening the rice supply in the foreseeable future.

What is the willingness of farm households in the Mekong River Delta to contribute towards a salinity intrusion risk reduction program, and how does this vary depending on the current and expected future impacts of salinity intrusion on agricultural productivity?	Over half of the farm households in the Mekong River Delta are willing to contribute to a fund aimed at reducing the risk of salinity intrusion. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity on their farms. Those households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in areas with lower or no current risk. However, even households not currently affected by salinity intrusion are willing to contribute to a salinity management program. The total amount that these households are prepared to pay is significant and could potentially cover the total costs of such a program.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
What are the two processes causing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta and what percentage of the total MRD agricultural area could be impacted by 2030 under current sea level increase predictions?	The two processes causing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta are a) rising sea levels due to adverse climate change and b) a significant decline in river flows as a result of upstream dam construction and increased extractions of water. Under current sea level increase predictions, it is estimated that up to 45% of the total Mekong River Delta agricultural area could be impacted by 2030.

"""What are some of the short-term and long-term solutions being considered to manage the increasing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?"""	One short-term solution being considered to manage the increasing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta is the construction of around 1469 km of concrete sea-dikes. This could help control the intrusion of saltwater into the delta. A long-term solution could involve farmers adapting to the changing conditions. For instance, they could transition from rice production to fish or shrimp farming, which are more tolerant of saline conditions.	['The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;', 'In  recent  years,  however,  salinity  intrusion  has  become  the  most\nsigniﬁcant  challenge  faced  by  farm  households.Salinity  intrusion\nis  caused  by  two  processes:  a)  rising  sea  levels  as  a  result  of  adverse\nclimate  change  and  b)  a  signiﬁcant  decline  in  river  ﬂows  as  a  result\nof  upstream  dam  construction  and  increased  extractions  of  water.Reduced  upstream  ﬂow  rates  combined  with  increased  sea  lev-\n∗Corresponding author.E-mail addresses:  tiendung.khong@adelaide.edu.au ,  ktdung@ctu.edu.vn\n(T.D.Khong).els  under  climate  change  drive  lower  hydrologic  pressure  in  the\nMRD,  which  allows  salt  water  to  intrude  further  inland  (Danh  and\nKhai,  2014 ;  Le  Anh  Tuan  et  al.,  2007 ;  Smajgl  et  al.,  2015 ).According\nto  the  Vietnam  Academy  for  Water  Resources,  salinity  intrusion  is\non  the  increase  and  has  recently  been  detected  in  the  Kien  Giang\nand  Hau  Giang  provinces  (see  Fig.1)  (The  Vietnam  Academy  for\nWater  Resources,  2015 ).Currently,  around  620,000  ha  are  affected\nby  salinity  intrusion—roughly  16%  of  the  total  MRD  agricultural  pro-\nduction  area.By  2030  under  current  sea  level  increase  predictions,\nit  is  estimated  that  up  to  45%  of  the  MRD  agricultural  area  could\nbe  impacted,  with  coastal  provinces  such  as  Tien  Giang,  Tra  Vinh,\nSoc  Trang,  Bac  Lieu,  Ca  Mau,  and  Ben  Tre  experiencing  the  highest\nlevels  of  impact  (Center  of  Environmental  Engineering,  2012) .Adverse  impacts  of  sea  level  rise  are  being  worsened  by  increas-\ning  upstream  development  along  the  Mekong  River.The  National\nHydro-Meteorological  Service  of  Vietnam  is  warning  that  the\nimpact  of  future  droughts,  similar  to  those  experienced  during  the\n2015  and  2016  El  Ni˜no  events,  will  also  be  worse  in  future,  creating\nfurther  negative  salinity  intrusion  outcomes.As  one  of  the  largest  rice  exporters  in  Asia,  disruptions  to\nMRD  agricultural  production  can  result  in  wider  serious  regional\nfood  security  issues,  as  well  as  reduced  national  trade  income.In  the  past,  MRD  farm  households  largely  treated  salinity  intru-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.12.010\n0378-3774/© 2017  Elsevier  B.V.

Based on the report, are local households in the Mekong River Delta willing to contribute to programs aimed at mitigating the risk of salinity intrusion, and if so, how much are they willing to contribute?	Yes, local households in the Mekong River Delta are willing to contribute to programs aimed at mitigating the risk of salinity intrusion. Over 50 percent of farm households expressed a willingness to contribute to a fund for this purpose. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity. Those households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in lower or no-current risk areas. However, even those currently unaffected by salinity intrusion are willing to pay for a salinity management program. The total amount that farm households are prepared to pay is significant and may be sufficient to cover the total costs of such a program. The exact amount they are willing to contribute was not specified in the context.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
What factors have been identified in previous studies that influence a farm household's willingness to pay for climate change risk reduction programs, such as those aimed at managing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta?	The factors identified that influence a farm household's willingness to pay for climate change risk reduction programs, such as those aimed at managing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta, include the level of risk they face from salinity intrusion and the expected impacts of salinity on their farms. Households in areas currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in lower or no-current risk areas. However, even households that are currently unaffected by salinity intrusion have shown a willingness to pay for a salinity management program.

What are the five different bid values chosen for the monthly payment vehicle in the study, and what are they equivalent to in US dollars?	The context does not provide information on the five different bid values chosen for the monthly payment vehicle in the study, nor their equivalent in US dollars.	['As stated above,  in  our  CVM  survey  farm  households  were  asked\nto  respond  to  the  willingness  to  pay  bid  value  question  in  one  of\nthree  ways:  ‘Yes,’  ‘No’  or  ‘Do  not  know’.In  the  analysis  model  /H9251  and\nˇ  are  coefﬁcients,  and  X  is  a  vector  of  the  socio-economic  explana-\ntory  variables  related  to  an  individual’s  selection  including:  farm\nhousehold  income,  head  of  household’s  age,  head  of  household’s\ngender,  farm  household  size,  head  of  household’s  education  and\ntotal  farming  experience  (Table  1).The  non-parametric  technique  is\nemployed  to  estimate  the  mean  values  for  WTP.This  technique  was\nsuggested  by  previous  researchers  in  the  same  survey  area  (Ðan\nand  Duyên,  2010 ;

 Botzen  and  van  den  Bergh,  2012 ;  Zhai,  2006 ).For  exam-\nple,  willingness  to  pay  was  positively  associated  with  the  size  of\nthe  risk  reduction  (Alberini  and  Chiabai,  2007 ;  Botzen  and  van\nden  Bergh,  2012 ;  Zhai,  2006 ),  respondent  age  and  health  (Alberini\nand  Chiabai,  2007 ),  income  (Zhai,  2006 )  and  proximity  to  the  risk\n(Concu,  2007 ).However,  WTP  can  decrease  with  acceptability  of\n(ﬂood)  risk  and  environmental  information  provision  (Zhai,  2006 ).Moreover,  risk awareness and  geographical  characteristics  are  also\nnoted  as  important  factors  inﬂuencing  respondents’  willingness  to\npay (Botzen  and  Van  Den  Bergh,  2008 ).In  those  studies,  referen-\ndum  and  payment  cards  were  employed  broadly  as  the  instrument\nof CVM elicitation,  and  so  we  follow  that  approach  in  this  paper.2.Methods\nConsistent  with  many  of  the  studies  of  climate  change  risk\nreduction  cited  above,  we  employ  the  CVM  approach  to  estimate\nfarm  household  willingness  to  pay  for  MRD  salinity  intrusion  man-\nagement  programs.CVM  was  ﬁrst  proposed  by  Ciriacy-Wantrup\n(1947) ,  and  since  the  1970s  the  methodology  has  been  routinely\napplied  to  measure  the  beneﬁts  of  a  variety  of  goods  such  as  recre-\nation,  hunting,  water  quality  and  decreased  mortality  risk  from\naccidents  (Khai  and  Yabe,  2014 ).In  essence,  CVM  requires  each\nparticipant  in  a  study  to  respond  by  employing  four  types  of  ques-\ntion  including  open-ended,  dichotomous  choice,  iterative  bidding\nor  payment  card.The  most  common  question  format  is  an  open-\nended  and  dichotomous  choice.Although  debate  over  the  best\nform  of  CVM  questionnaire  continues,  dichotomous  choice  rather\nthan  open-ended  elicitation  approaches  are  recommended  due\nto  minimization  of  opportunities  for  strategic  behaviour,  and  an\nargument  that  such  questions  are  cognitively  easier  on  respon-\ndents  (Mitchell  and  Carson,  1989 ).The  valuation  question  in  this\nstudy  thus  required  each  participant  to  respond  to  a  dichotomous\nchoice  based  on  WTP  guidelines  by  Bateman  et  al.(2002)  and  the\nCompetition Commission  (2010) .']
What are the proposed program options to reduce salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how would they be funded according to the survey conducted?	The proposed program options to reduce salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta include converting current earth sea-dike-walls to concrete structures, upgrading existing or building new river-mouth sluicegate systems, and planting new or reforesting degraded existing mangrove systems next to sea-dike-walls. According to the survey, households were asked if they would be willing to contribute monthly to fund these programs. The collected funds would be administered by a committee, which includes local government, local and international consultants, and representatives from non-government organizations. This committee would then decide how to invest in concrete sea-dike-walls, sluice-gate construction, and mangrove forest in their local area. The programs aim to reduce current and expected future salinity intrusion risk in their relevant village area.	['The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;', 'This  included  a  range\nof  hypothetical  salinity  reduction  program  options.Possible  pro-\ngram  options  suggested  in  this  survey  included  converting  current\nearth  sea-dike-walls  to  concrete  structures,  upgrading  existing  or\nbuilding  new  river-mouth  sluicegate  systems,  and  the  planting  of\nnew  or  reforestation  of  degraded  existing  mangrove  systems  next\nto  sea-dike-walls.Each  respondent  was  then  asked  whether  or  not\nthey  (their  household)  would  be  willing  to  contribute  monthly  to\nfund  such  programs.They  were  told  that  the  program  funds  would\nbe  administered  by  a  committee  including  their  local  government,\nlocal  and  international  consultants,  and  representatives  from  non-\ngovernment  organizations.This  committee  would  then  decide  how\nto  invest  in  concrete  sea-dike-walls,  sluice-gate  construction  and\nmangrove  forest  in  their  local  area.It  was  made  clear  that  these  pro-\ngrams  would  seek  to  reduce  current  and  expected  future  salinity\nintrusion  risk  in  their  relevant  village  area.Following  the  guidelines  from  Arrow  et  al.(1993)  and\nCompetition Commission  (2010) ,  willingness  to  pay  bids  were  col-\nlected using  a  referendum  style  format  where  respondents  could\nselect  one  of  three  options:  ‘Yes’,  ‘No’,  or  ‘Do  not  know’  (‘DK’).During  the  survey,  respondents  were  given  an  opportunity  to\nreconsider  their  vote  before  asking  them  to  nominate  their  speciﬁc\nmonthly  payment  bid.Each  possible  willingness  to  pay  bid  value\nwas  provided  to  at  least  30  of  the  randomly  selected  farm  house-\nholds,  for  a  total  of  150  observations  from  each  area.After  data\ncleaning,  there  were  4414useable  observations  from  three  different\nsalinity-impact  areas.Despite  some  disadvantages  with  referen-\ndum  approaches,  such  as  a  limited  range  for  the  bid-values  offered,\nthis  option  simpliﬁes  the  respondent’s  cognitive  task  (Pearce  et  al.,\n2002 )  which  is  an  important  factor  in  survey  areas  where  farm\n1US$1  dollar  was  equal  to  22,695  Vietnamese  dong  (VND)  at  May  01,  2017.2Enumerators  were  carefully  chosen  from  staff  and  ﬁnal-year  students  from\nDepartment\n of  Agricultural  Economics,  College  of  Economics  at  the  Can  Tho  Univer-\nsity.Those  with  previous  experience  of  survey  data  collection  and  CVM  approaches\nwere\n speciﬁcally  targeted.Each  enumerator  also  received  additional  training  before\nthe\n ofﬁcial  survey  took  place.3Sample  copies  of  the  questionnaire  are  available  from  the  corresponding  author\nin\n Vietnamese  and  English.4Sample  size  was  identiﬁed  by  function:  n  =  z2\n1−˛/2P(1  −  P)/d2.']
What methods were used in the study to reduce the likelihood of over-estimations in the willingness to pay, and how were the responses of the participants cross-checked?	The study used several methods to reduce the likelihood of over-estimations in the willingness to pay. These included survey pretesting before official data collection, adopting face-to-face surveying approaches, and framing the willingness to pay question in the form of a referendum that includes a 'No vote' or 'Do not know' response option. The study also employed ex-ante bias correction using a cheap talk instrument, which is designed to mitigate hypothetical bias by explaining the risk of this outcome to respondents before asking the valuation questions. The version of the cheap talk approach used was based on the 'short and neutral' approaches. The cheap talk script was tested to ensure good understanding by participants in the pilot survey. The approach included a reminder to respondents to consider budget constraints when making their responses, and treating their decision as if the payment were real. The responses of the participants were cross-checked with information about the respondent’s socio-economic characteristics and their ability to pay. An ex-post robustness approach was also adopted using a follow-up question asking respondents to specify the certainty of their answers. This allowed the farm household participants more time to reconsider their responses before a firm decision was made and noted in the questionnaire.

 Carson  et  al.,  1998 ;  Champ  et  al.,  2005 ;  Pearce\net  al.,  2002 ;  Wang,  1997 ).In  this  study,  we  also  employed  ex-ante  bias  correction  by  using\na  cheap  talk  instrument,  which  is  designed  to  mitigate  hypothetical\nbias  by explaining the  risk  of  this  outcome  to  respondents  before\nasking  the  valuation  questions  (Competition  Commission,  2010 ;\nMahieu et al.,  2012 ).The  version  of  the  cheap  talk  approach  we\nused  was  based  on  the  ‘short  and  neutral’  approaches  developed  by\nAadland and Caplan  (2006) ,  Do  and  Bennett  (2007)  and  Khai  and\nYabe  (2014) .The  cheap  talk  scrip  was  also  tested  to  ensure  good\nunderstanding by participants  in  the  pilot  survey.Our  approach\nincluded  a  reminder  to  respondents  to  consider  budget  constraints\nwhen  making  their  responses,  and  treating  their  decision  as  if  the\npayment  were  real.This  information  is  then  cross-checked  with\ninformation  about  the  respondent’s  socio-economic  characteris-\ntics  and  their  ability  to  pay.Finally,  an  ex-post  robustness  approach\nwas  also  adopted  using  a  follow-up  question  asking  respondents\nto  specify  the  certainty  of  their  answers  (Champ  et  al.,  1997 ;\nCompetition  Commission,  2010 ;  Whitehead  and  Cherry,  2007 ).In\nthese  approaches,  the  farm  household  participants  had  more  time\nto  reconsider  their  responses  before  a  ﬁrm  decision  was  made  and\nnoted  in  the  questionnaire.2.2.Analytical  method\nThe  basic  theory  of  CVM  approach  was  proposed  by  Hanemann\n(1984) ,  with  concepts  derived  from  consumer  theory.', '82  T.D.Khong  et  al./  Agricultural  Water  Management  200  (2018)  80–89\nbe  directly  related  to  developing  nation  contexts.As  a  result,  this\npaper  contributes  to  signiﬁcant  gaps  in  the  literature  by  applying  a\nreferendum  contingent  valuation  methodology  to  evaluate  devel-\noping  country  community  contributions  toward  climate  change\nrisk  reduction  programs  in  the  form  of  concrete  sea-dike  walls  in\nthe  MRD.This  paper  also  attempts  to  identify  the  determinants  of  farm\nhousehold  characteristics  on  WTP.Previous  studies  have  found  a\nnumber  of  factors  affecting  people’s  WTP  for  climate  change  risk\nreduction  in  Japan,  the  Netherlands  and  Italy  (Alberini  and  Chiabai,\n2007 ;  Botzen  and  van  den  Bergh,  2012 ;  Zhai,  2006 ).For  exam-\nple,  willingness  to  pay  was  positively  associated  with  the  size  of\nthe  risk  reduction  (Alberini  and  Chiabai,  2007 ;  Botzen  and  van\nden  Bergh,  2012 ;  Zhai,  2006 ),  respondent  age  and  health  (Alberini\nand  Chiabai,  2007 ),  income  (Zhai,  2006 )  and  proximity  to  the  risk\n(Concu,  2007 ).However,  WTP  can  decrease  with  acceptability  of\n(ﬂood)  risk  and  environmental  information  provision  (Zhai,  2006 ).Moreover,  risk awareness and  geographical  characteristics  are  also\nnoted  as  important  factors  inﬂuencing  respondents’  willingness  to\npay (Botzen  and  Van  Den  Bergh,  2008 ).In  those  studies,  referen-\ndum  and  payment  cards  were  employed  broadly  as  the  instrument\nof CVM elicitation,  and  so  we  follow  that  approach  in  this  paper.2.Methods\nConsistent  with  many  of  the  studies  of  climate  change  risk\nreduction  cited  above,  we  employ  the  CVM  approach  to  estimate\nfarm  household  willingness  to  pay  for  MRD  salinity  intrusion  man-\nagement  programs.CVM  was  ﬁrst  proposed  by  Ciriacy-Wantrup\n(1947) ,  and  since  the  1970s  the  methodology  has  been  routinely\napplied  to  measure  the  beneﬁts  of  a  variety  of  goods  such  as  recre-\nation,  hunting,  water  quality  and  decreased  mortality  risk  from\naccidents  (Khai  and  Yabe,  2014 ).In  essence,  CVM  requires  each\nparticipant  in  a  study  to  respond  by  employing  four  types  of  ques-\ntion  including  open-ended,  dichotomous  choice,  iterative  bidding\nor  payment  card.The  most  common  question  format  is  an  open-\nended  and  dichotomous  choice.Although  debate  over  the  best\nform  of  CVM  questionnaire  continues,  dichotomous  choice  rather\nthan  open-ended  elicitation  approaches  are  recommended  due\nto  minimization  of  opportunities  for  strategic  behaviour,  and  an\nargument  that  such  questions  are  cognitively  easier  on  respon-\ndents  (Mitchell  and  Carson,  1989 ).The  valuation  question  in  this\nstudy  thus  required  each  participant  to  respond  to  a  dichotomous\nchoice  based  on  WTP  guidelines  by  Bateman  et  al.(2002)  and  the\nCompetition Commission  (2010) .']

"""What were the main reasons why some farm households in the Mekong Delta were unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program?"""	The main reasons why some farm households in the Mekong Delta were unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program included not being able to afford the amount, skepticism about the actual use of their contribution for the program, belief that it's the government's responsibility, and confidence in their own adaptation options.	['This  included  a  range\nof  hypothetical  salinity  reduction  program  options.Possible  pro-\ngram  options  suggested  in  this  survey  included  converting  current\nearth  sea-dike-walls  to  concrete  structures,  upgrading  existing  or\nbuilding  new  river-mouth  sluicegate  systems,  and  the  planting  of\nnew  or  reforestation  of  degraded  existing  mangrove  systems  next\nto  sea-dike-walls.Each  respondent  was  then  asked  whether  or  not\nthey  (their  household)  would  be  willing  to  contribute  monthly  to\nfund  such  programs.They  were  told  that  the  program  funds  would\nbe  administered  by  a  committee  including  their  local  government,\nlocal  and  international  consultants,  and  representatives  from  non-\ngovernment  organizations.This  committee  would  then  decide  how\nto  invest  in  concrete  sea-dike-walls,  sluice-gate  construction  and\nmangrove  forest  in  their  local  area.It  was  made  clear  that  these  pro-\ngrams  would  seek  to  reduce  current  and  expected  future  salinity\nintrusion  risk  in  their  relevant  village  area.Following  the  guidelines  from  Arrow  et  al.(1993)  and\nCompetition Commission  (2010) ,  willingness  to  pay  bids  were  col-\nlected using  a  referendum  style  format  where  respondents  could\nselect  one  of  three  options:  ‘Yes’,  ‘No’,  or  ‘Do  not  know’  (‘DK’).During  the  survey,  respondents  were  given  an  opportunity  to\nreconsider  their  vote  before  asking  them  to  nominate  their  speciﬁc\nmonthly  payment  bid.Each  possible  willingness  to  pay  bid  value\nwas  provided  to  at  least  30  of  the  randomly  selected  farm  house-\nholds,  for  a  total  of  150  observations  from  each  area.After  data\ncleaning,  there  were  4414useable  observations  from  three  different\nsalinity-impact  areas.Despite  some  disadvantages  with  referen-\ndum  approaches,  such  as  a  limited  range  for

farm  household  income  and  bid  valueare  strongly  correlated  with  increased  probability  of  willingness  to\npay;  that  is,  high  farm  income  correlates  with  a  positive

What does the report suggest about the proportion of farmers in the control group versus other groups who were unsure about the bid levels in the study on salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?	The report suggests that the proportion of farmers in the control group who were unsure about the bid levels rapidly falls to zero. However, in the other groups, the proportion of farmers who were unsure remains positive, albeit at relatively low levels.

What are the main reasons why farmers in the Mekong River Delta are not willing to contribute to salinity reduction efforts?	The main reasons why farmers in the Mekong River Delta are not willing to contribute to salinity reduction efforts include: they cannot afford the amount required for the contribution, they do not believe the amount they would pay will actually be used for the program, they believe it is the government's responsibility to handle the issue, and they think they can deal with the issue using their own adaptation options.

Based on the study, does the willingness of farmers in the Mekong River Delta to pay for salinity intrusion reduction programs increase or decrease with their experience in farming?	The study does not provide information on whether the willingness of farmers in the Mekong River Delta to pay for salinity intrusion reduction programs increases or decreases with their experience in farming.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
What is the average monthly contribution that farm households in the Mekong Delta are willing to make towards salinity reduction programs?

Based on the study, what is the willingness of Mekong River Delta farm households to contribute financially towards projects aimed at mitigating the impacts of salinity intrusion?	The study indicates that over 50% of Mekong River Delta farm households are willing to contribute financially to a fund aimed at reducing the risk of salinity intrusion. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity. Those households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to contribute to risk reduction programs than those in areas with lower or no current risk. However, even households not currently affected by salinity intrusion expressed a willingness to contribute to a salinity management program. When considered collectively, the total amount these households are prepared to pay could potentially cover the total costs of such a program.

What is one possible solution to manage salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how might it affect the livelihoods of farmers in the region?	One possible solution to manage salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta is to build around 1469 km of concrete sea-dikes. This could affect the livelihoods of farmers in the region as they may need to adapt to the changes brought about by salinity intrusion. For instance, they might have to shift from rice production to fish or shrimp farming.

What information does the sea-dike map provide about the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	The sea-dike map provides information about the existing and potential sea-dike walls in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) in Vietnam. It shows that the MRD, a vast floodplain only 0-4 meters above mean sea level, has had more than 11,000 kilometers of canals and approximately 2000 kilometers of dike walls constructed over the last 300 years to mitigate flooding. The Vietnamese government has plans to upgrade these dike walls and increase maintenance, including the construction of additional earthen sea-dikes and concrete sluice gates along the coastline. However, due to a shortage of suitable soils and high erosion rates, there is consideration for the construction of concrete sea-dike walls. The total length of required sea-dike walls in the MRD is estimated to be 1469 kilometers, but due to public budget constraints, it is argued that Vietnam cannot afford to build the total required lengths.

What is the estimated cost of constructing concrete sea-dike-walls of different heights across rural Vietnam to control salinity intrusion, according to the context?	The estimated cost of constructing concrete sea-dike-walls across rural Vietnam varies depending on the height of the walls. For a two-meter sea-dike-wall, the construction cost is approximately US$1.16 million per kilometer. This cost increases to US$1.93 million per kilometer for a three-meter wall, and to US$2.79 million per kilometer for a four-meter wall. The total funding required for the construction across the identified coastal area of the Mekong River Delta would be approximately US$1.7 billion for two-meter walls, US$2.8 billion for three-meter walls, and US$4.1 billion for four-meter walls.

Based on the context, how much would each farm household in the Mekong River Delta need to contribute annually to cover the cost of building a concrete sea-dike to protect farmlands from climate change-induced sea level rise?

What are the potential solutions for salinity intrusion in the Soc Trang Province of the Mekong Delta, as mentioned in the report?	One potential solution for salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, as mentioned in the report, is the construction of approximately 1469 km of concrete sea-dikes. Another possible solution is for farmers to adapt to the salinity intrusion by shifting from rice production to fish or shrimp farming.

What measures have been suggested in the report to adapt to the rising sea levels in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta?	The report suggests several measures to adapt to the rising sea levels in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta. These include changing irrigation schedules, increasing water storage in dams, and altering rice-planting times. These are considered short-term solutions. For long-term solutions, the report suggests public intervention, such as the construction of concrete sea-dikes or embankment structures to prevent water inundation onto low-lying floodplain areas. The report also mentions the possibility of upgrading dike walls and increasing maintenance in the central and southern Mekong River Delta, including the construction of additional earthen sea-dikes and concrete sluice gates along the coastline. Another suggestion is for farmers to adapt to salinity intrusion by transitioning from rice production to fish or shrimp farming.

What are the challenges faced by agriculture in the Mekong Delta due to changing climate, sea level rise, stronger monsoons, prolonged droughts, and increased saltwater intrusion?	The agriculture in the Mekong Delta faces several challenges due to changing climate, sea level rise, stronger monsoons, prolonged droughts, and increased saltwater intrusion. These include the repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding. This increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, and increases FeS2 buildup, leading to reduced agriculture productivity. It also degrades surface water quality and makes aquatic ecosystems vulnerable. The changing climate has altered the predictable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes, making it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops. The region is also challenged to increase their adaptation and agricultural production strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and that Vietnamese farmers are able to make a living.	['86A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4security and rural livelihoods (World Bank \n2022; Loc et al.2021).According to the World Bank (2022), Vietnam is among the world’s most vulnerable climate risk coun -\ntries, ranked 13th among 180 countries by Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index 2000 to 2019.In response to these changing condi -\ntions, the delta floodwater control system is being modified to encourage farmers to diversify their cropping systems and be more attentive to the environmental impacts of agriculture (Luu et al.2022).Vietnam Resolution 120/2017/NQ-CP , issued in 2017, promotes “living with floods,” “uncertainty adaptation,” and nature-based approaches for addressing climate change and upstream develop -\nment (Luu et al.2022).Delta farmers are challenged to make a living under these stressful and uncertain conditions.They continue to seek innovative water management and drainage approaches and adapt cropping systems to changing soil-water conditions, building on their accumulated local knowledge and sci -\nentific findings gained from laboratory and field experiments.Understanding the chemical and biogeophysical prop -\nerties and pedogenic processes of acid sulfate soils, developing climate-flexible crops and management systems as well as increasing crop genetic tolerances to Al and salt concentrations are foundational to effective delta agricultural adaptation.TRANSFORMING A LARGE TROPICAL \nDELTA INTO AN AGRICULTURAL \nLANDSCAPE \nFresh water for agriculture and drinking has for centuries been scarce during the long five-month dry season with saline water incursions making the acidic delta soils less productive for crops and the shallow ground water salty and not safe for cooking or drinking (Taylor 2014).Historically this wild, untamed, vast flood-plain was sparsely settled with agriculture and small settlements on marine sandy coastal dunes—fresh water oases—cre-ated as flooding and river sediments built out the delta.It was not until the French colonization (1800s) and Vietnamese state (1980s) undertook large irrigation pro -\ngrams to construct canals to channel fresh water from the Mekong and Bassac riv -\ners to reduce water and soil salinity that agricultural systems replaced the wetland ecosystem (Taylor 2014; Luu et al.2022).At first natural waterways were straight-\nened and deepened, and then connected by canals.The French Colonial Government set about clearing forests and draining wetlands to turn the underutilized and agriculturally unproductive soils into rice production.These sparsely populated, densely vegetated acid sulfate lands were used by resistance fighters as hideouts dur -\ning the US Vietnam War (1961 to 1973).After the war, the Vietnam state established large-scale state farms (1,000 to 10,000 ha [2,471 to 24,710 ac]) to increase the delta population and alleviate serious food shortages (van Mensvoort 1996).Newly resettled farmers were inexperienced in managing waterlogged acid sulfate soils to make them productive, and the state farms were inadequately funded with a shortage of knowledge and equipment resources as well as insufficient farm workers for large-scale parcels.Excess water on the landscape in monsoon season alternating with dry season freshwater scarcity made delta living conditions harsh, and most of these collective farms failed to grow enough food for farmers to make a living (van Mensvoort 1996).By the mid-1980s irrigation projects \nexpanded throughout the delta to create a freshwater network across the entire pen-insula with sluice gates that protected the waterway grid from saline intrusion and reengineered the waterscape to drain and control water for rice agriculture (Taylor 2014).Rice establishes and grows well in waterlogged environments but is sensitive to salinity with an electric conductivity (EC\nSPE) threshold of 3 dS m–1 (Korres et \nal.2022).The saline delta rivers, wetlands, and marshes were converted into peren-nial freshwater zones.This reduced the seasonal variation in water flow patterns, converted the flood plain into regulated canals, dykes, and polders that irrigated agriculture, and prevented annual flood waters from submerging fields (and sedi -\nments from replenishing soil fertility) (Luu et.2022).T oday’s Vietnam Mekong Delta agri -\ncultural landscape is built on managing and controlling the quantity and distri-bution of water year round (flooding, irrigation, fresh and saline waters) in allu -\nvial and acid sulfate soils (figure 2).', '91A\nJULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4 JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONLIVING WITH SALINITY: AGRICULTURAL \nADAPTATIONS TO SALINE ACID \nSULFATE SOILS\nOne meter (3.3 ft) of sea-level rise would \ninundate 79% of Ca Mau and 76% of Kien Giang provinces in the Vietnam Mekong Delta.The World Bank (2022) predicts that without adaptation, 45% of the delta will be affected by salinity.Below are eight rec -\nommendations to guide Vietnam Mekong Delta policymakers, scientists, local leaders, and farmers in effectively adapting and liv -\ning with salinity while continuing to make acid sulfate soils productive and delta eco -\nsystems sustainable and healthy: \n1. widen the adoption of di versified \ncropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization;\n2. incr ease research, field evaluations, and \napplications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improve plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater;\n3. incr ease freshwater flows and aquifer \nrecharge to offset saltwater intrusion;\n4. pr oactively prepare and protect lands \nand settlements to increase resilience against tropical cyclones; drought-flooding extremes; and soil, coastal, and riverbank erosion;\n5. manage pestic ide and fertilizer use to \nmeet crop nutrient needs while simul -\ntaneously reducing and eliminating pesticide and fertilizer contamination of soil, ditches, canals, and rivers;\n6. r estore and maintain wetlands and man -\ngrove forests as multibenefit resources;\n7. enab le delta farmers and fishers to \nmake a living that supports their households; and\n8. r estrict new development in eco-\nsensitive and fragile environmental regions, and strengthen and enforce land use regulations.CONCLUSION: UNCERTAINTY \nADAPTATION \nThe 1980s “rice first” policy promoted engineered ditches, canals, and sluice gates that provided freshwater irrigation, managed flooding, eliminated saltwater intrusion and drained acid sulfate soils to reclaim thousands of hectares for the intensification of rice production (Olson and Morton 2018; Ngan et al.2018; Luu et al.2022).While Vietnamese Mekong Delta farmers have learned over the decades to manage flood-drought cycles in acid sulfate soils, the increasing instability in global cli-mate and local weather conditions present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges.The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS\n2 buildup leading to reduced \nagriculture productivity, degrades surface water quality, and makes aquatic ecosys -\ntems vulnerable (Tully et al.2019; Mosley et al.2017).A changing climate has altered the \npredicable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes and made it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops.Climate change, sea level rise, human land use management, increased population, and the rise in food and nutrition insecurity is again challenging the region to ratchet up their adaptation and agricultural pro -\nduction strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and that Vietnamese farmers are able to make a living.Local and indigenous farmer knowl-\nedge and university scientific research have combined to create innovative land man-agement approaches, engineer extensive water management projects, and develop salt-tolerant crop varieties to make acid sulfate soils agriculturally productive.Continuous research and experimentation will be needed to respond and prepare for present and future uncertainties.Adaptive integration of biogeophysical, \npedogenic, and social knowledge is critical in deepening understanding of landscape and local surface level drainage impacts and soil-water relationships under increas -\ningly variable conditions.Observing and learning more about the connections and synergies among rates of percolation, soil management effects on macropores and mesopores, the role of bypass flows in raised bed soil leaching processes, densities and types of beneficial bacteria in pro-ductive soils, and plant breeding for salt tolerance will be essential to living with uncertainty and strengthening delta sus -\ntainability and resilience.']

Luu et al.2022).At first natural waterways were straight-\nened and deepened, and then connected by canals.The French Colonial Government set about clearing forests and draining wetlands to turn the underutilized and agriculturally unproductive soils into rice production.These sparsely populated, densely vegetated acid sulfate lands were used by resistance fighters as hideouts dur -\ning the US Vietnam War (1961 to 1973).After the war, the Vietnam state established large-scale state farms (1,000 to 10,000 ha [2,471 to 24,710 ac]) to increase the delta population and alleviate serious food shortages (van Mensvoort 1996).Newly resettled farmers were inexperienced in managing waterlogged acid sulfate soils to make them productive, and the state farms were inadequately funded with a shortage of knowledge and equipment resources as well as insufficient farm workers for large-scale parcels.Excess water on the landscape in monsoon season alternating with dry season freshwater scarcity made delta living conditions harsh, and most of these collective farms failed to grow enough food for farmers to make a living (van Mensvoort 1996).By the mid-1980s irrigation projects \nexpanded throughout the delta to create a freshwater network across the entire pen-insula with sluice gates that protected the waterway grid from saline intrusion and reengineered the waterscape to drain and control water for rice agriculture (Taylor 2014).Rice establishes and grows well in waterlogged environments but is sensitive to salinity with an electric conductivity (EC\nSPE) threshold of 3 dS m–1 (Korres et \nal.2022).The saline delta rivers, wetlands, and marshes were converted into peren-nial freshwater zones.This reduced the seasonal variation in water flow patterns, converted the flood plain into regulated canals, dykes, and polders that irrigated agriculture, and prevented annual flood waters from submerging fields (and sedi -\nments from replenishing soil fertility) (Luu et.2022).T oday’s Vietnam Mekong Delta agri -\ncultural landscape is built on managing and controlling the quantity and distri-bution of water year round (flooding, irrigation, fresh and saline waters) in allu -\nvial and acid sulfate soils (figure 2).', '91A\nJULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4 JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONLIVING WITH SALINITY: AGRICULTURAL \nADAPTATIONS TO SALINE ACID \nSULFATE SOILS\nOne meter (3.3 ft) of sea-level rise would \ninundate 79% of Ca Mau and 76% of Kien Giang provinces in the Vietnam Mekong Delta.The World Bank (2022) predicts that without adaptation, 45% of the delta will be affected by salinity.Below are eight rec -\nommendations to guide Vietnam Mekong Delta policymakers, scientists, local leaders, and farmers in effectively adapting and liv -\ning with salinity while continuing to make acid sulfate soils productive and delta eco -\nsystems sustainable and healthy: \n1. widen the adoption of di versified \ncropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization;\n2. incr ease research, field evaluations, and \napplications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improve plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater;\n3. incr ease freshwater flows and aquifer \nrecharge to offset saltwater intrusion;\n4. pr oactively prepare and protect lands \nand settlements to increase resilience against tropical cyclones;

Ngan et al.2018; Luu et al.2022).While Vietnamese Mekong Delta farmers have learned over the decades to manage flood-drought cycles in acid sulfate soils, the increasing instability in global cli-mate and local weather conditions present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges.The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS\n2 buildup leading to reduced \nagriculture productivity, degrades surface water quality, and makes aquatic ecosys -\ntems vulnerable (Tully et al.2019;

What measures are being taken to control salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how does the shifting of salinity concentrations during the dry season affect the soil and water in the region?	To control salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, several measures are being implemented. These include water control projects such as high dyke and flood control, and salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture. Canals that link to the Bassac and Mekong main stem rivers and their distributaries are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements. Sluice gates are also used to allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide, and are closed during the dry season and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields.During the dry season, the receding waters lead to shifting salinity concentrations in the waterways. This can exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease, allowing saline water to move further inland. This intrusion, known as the landward movement of saltwater, alters soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. This can have significant impacts on the soil and water in the region, affecting both agriculture and the overall ecosystem.	['Water control projects consist of high dyke and flood control, salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture, and salinity control in brackish water aquaculture (Ngan et al 2018).Canals that link to the Bassac and Mekong main stem rivers and their dis -\ntributaries are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements.During the rainy season, many of these same canals are used to drain the land and release flood waters back into rivers and the West and East China Seas (Ngan et al 2018; Hanhart et al.1997).Extensive agricultural drain-age ditches and canals lower the water table and speed up hydrologic exchanges between the coastal landscape and the ocean which can increase salt concentra -\ntion (Tully et al.2019).Sluice gates allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide and are closed during the dry sea -\nson and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields (figure 2).ACID SULFATE SOILS OF THE VIETNAM \nMEKONG DELTA \nAcid sulfate soils occupy more than 40% of the Vietnam Mekong Delta (figure 1).Soils are characterized by high Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations and low pH 2.7 to \n3.5, >0.5 mol Fe2+ and 0.05 mol Al3+ m–3.A large portion of these soils are under-water annually for several months during the monsoon season.Sea level rise, sea -\nsonal and increasingly variable cyclones, coastal storms, and high tides flood coastal regions and push seawater upriver mix-ing with fresh water.The onset of the dry season is accompanied by receding waters and shifting salinity concentrations in the waterways with sluice gates and dyke sys-tems built to irrigate and drain the interior landscape and control salinity intrusion.Drought periods can exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease and allow saline water to move further inland (Tully et al.2019).Saltwater intrusion, the land-ward movement of saltwater, alters soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', '86A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4security and rural livelihoods (World Bank \n2022;

What are some of the strategies suggested in the report to manage acid sulfate soils and improve crop yield in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	The report suggests several strategies to manage acid sulfate soils and improve crop yield in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These include widening the adoption of diversified cropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization. It also recommends increasing research, field evaluations, and applications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improving plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater. Other strategies include increasing freshwater flows and aquifer recharge to offset saltwater intrusion, preparing and protecting lands and settlements to increase resilience against various environmental challenges, managing pesticide and fertilizer use to meet crop nutrient needs while reducing contamination, restoring and maintaining wetlands and mangrove forests, enabling delta farmers and fishers to make a living, and restricting new development in eco-sensitive and fragile environmental regions.

"""What factors influence the height of the constructed raised beds in managing salinity and acid sulfate soils in the Mekong Delta, and how does the height of these beds affect the available soil volume for roots?"""	The height of the constructed raised beds in managing salinity and acid sulfate soils in the Mekong Delta is influenced by several factors. These include the depth to the acid sulfate horizon, the depth to the water table during the growing season, the role of capillary rise, the specific crop being grown, and the time and cost of labor. The height of these beds impacts the available soil volume for roots. A higher raised bed results in a thicker zone of leaching and a greater distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, thereby increasing the available soil volume for roots.	['The depth to the acid sulfate hori -\nzon, depth to water table during growing season, the role of capillary rise, the spe -\ncific crop grown, and the time and cost of labor influence the height of the con -\nstructed raised beds.Evapotranspiration will pull water upwards during the dry season, potentially leaving behind Na\n2SO4 \nand other salts.The higher the raised bed, the thicker the zone of leaching will be and distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, thus increasing the available soil volume for roots.Freshly excavated soil deposited as \nridges or shaped into raised beds create a network of macropores between soil clods that enable water to flow through the top -\nsoil and bypass the unsaturated soil matrix.Water moving through the macropores of newly constructed raised beds can quickly Figure 2\nThis sluice gate in Soc Trang Province, Vietnam, connects a main canal to the \nSouth China Sea and controls saltwater tidal inflow and flooding outflow.Open sluice gates allow fields to drain after heavy rains and flooding and are closed during high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to irrigate agricultural fields.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', '88A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL. 78, NO. 4remove/leach soluble Al and other soluble \nsubstances from the surface of the soil clods into the drainage/irrigation ditch (figure 4). Flushing raised beds with fresh water (water low in electrical conductivity and dissolved metals) two or three times before a crop is planted removes additional toxic substances that can affect crop roots and plant develop -\nment. Soil Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations \nare flushed with fresh water in annual raised bed systems that are submerged during normal flooding and then planted after the flooding recedes. The raised bed is rebuilt with topsoil after each monsoon flooding, then an annual crop is transplanted into the bed to grow; harvest occurs during the dry season with the cycle annually repeated (Minh et al. 1997a)\n Throughout the season, rain and/\nor freshwater irrigation consolidates and crusts over the soil surface in the raised bed, and mesopores form as crop roots grow and decay. This reduces the num-ber of water-conducting macropores and slows the movement of water through the soil profile reducing Al leaching (figure 5). Dry intervals increase Al\n3+ concentrations \nin the soil with infiltration after each pre -\ncipitation event removing some salts but at slower rates. When fresh water removes the Al from the soil it concentrates in the outflow to the ditch and can increase con -\ntamination in irrigation water downstream (Minh et al.1997a). Multiple-year, perennial raised beds with \ndeeper roots are built higher than annual beds (figure 3). Constructed from topsoil and sulfuric horizon soils while deepening ditches and clearing sediments during the dry season, the beds are left fallow during the following rainy season, flushing out Al and other salt concentrations. The use of the sulfuric horizon soil brings higher concen -trations of Al and SO\n42– to the raised bed \nand lowers the pH.

What is the process and purpose of flushing raised beds with fresh water in the context of managing salinity and acid sulfate soils in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Flushing raised beds with fresh water, which is low in electrical conductivity and dissolved metals, is a process used to manage salinity and acid sulfate soils in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. This is done two or three times before a crop is planted. The purpose of this process is to remove or leach soluble substances such as Al, Fe, and SO4 from the surface of the soil clods into the drainage or irrigation ditch. This helps to remove additional toxic substances that can affect crop roots and plant development. Throughout the season, rain and/or freshwater irrigation consolidates and crusts over the soil surface in the raised bed, and mesopores form as crop roots grow and decay. This reduces the number of water-conducting macropores and slows the movement of water through the soil profile, reducing Al leaching. Dry intervals increase Al3+ concentrations in the soil, with infiltration after each precipitation event removing some salts but at slower rates. When fresh water removes the Al from the soil, it concentrates in the outflow to the ditch and can increase contamination in irrigation water downstream.

Flushing raised beds with fresh water (water low in electrical conductivity and dissolved metals) two or three times before a crop is planted removes additional toxic substances that can affect crop roots and plant develop -\nment. Soil Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations \nare flushed with fresh water in annual raised bed systems that are submerged during normal flooding and then planted after the flooding recedes. The raised bed is rebuilt with topsoil after each monsoon flooding, then an annual crop is transplanted into the bed to grow; harvest occurs during the dry season with the cycle annually repeated (Minh et al. 1997a)\n Throughout the season, rain and/\nor freshwater irrigation consolidates and crusts over the soil surface in the raised bed, and mesopores form as crop roots grow and decay. This reduces the num-ber of water-conducting macropores and slows the movement of water through the soil profile reducing Al leaching (figure 5). Dry intervals increase Al\n3+ concentrations \nin the soil with infiltration after each pre -\ncipitation event removing some salts but at slower rates. When fresh water removes the Al from the soil it concentrates in the outflow to the ditch and can increase con -\ntamination in irrigation water downstream (Minh et al.1997a). Multiple-year, perennial raised beds with \ndeeper roots are built higher than annual beds (figure 3). Constructed from topsoil and sulfuric horizon soils while deepening ditches and clearing sediments during the dry season, the beds are left fallow during the following rainy season, flushing out Al and other salt concentrations. The use of the sulfuric horizon soil brings higher concen -trations of Al and SO\n42– to the raised bed \nand lowers the pH. After year 1 planting, development, bloom, fruiting, and harvest, the soil on the raised beds are not disturbed, and a perennial crop is grown on the raised bed for several years.

What are some of the aluminum-tolerant and saline-tolerant crops that can be grown in the acid sulfate soils of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and how do they adapt to these conditions?	Aluminum-tolerant crops such as the pineapple cultivar (Ananas comosus [L.] Merrill) can be grown in the acid sulfate soils of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. This perennial fruit tolerates low pH and high levels of soluble soil aluminum, grows well in low soil fertility, and is well adapted to acid sulfate soils. The roots of the pineapple are shallow, spreading laterally 1 to 1.5 m and 15 to 30 cm deep, making it well suited for deep-ditch raised bed management. Pineapple plants have also benefited from efforts to select varieties that can exclude aluminum from entering the root apex and root hairs. In addition to pineapple, other saline-tolerant fruit crops that can be grown in the delta soils of the Mekong Delta include aluminum-tolerant mango (Mangifera indica L.) and salt-tolerant coconut (Cocos nucifera L.). These crops are helping to diversify the current cropping systems in the region.

Pineapple roots are shallow, spread -\ning laterally 1 to 1.5 m (3.3 to 4.9 ft) and 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) deep, making it well suited for deep-ditch raised bed man-agement (figure 6) (Minh et al 1997b, Nga and van Meenvoort 1997). Pineapple has benefited from efforts to select plants with the ability to exclude Al from entering the root apex and root hairs (Le Van and Masuda 2004). Root elongation and color are two practical plant response indicators of Al toxicity that are useful to farmers in regulating field drainage in acid sulfate soils (Hanhart et al. 1997; LeVan and Masuda 2004).

Nguyen, and M. Scott DemyanSalinity and acid sulfate soils of the Vietnam Mekong \nDelta: Agricultural management and adaptation \nOne of the largest concentrations \nof acid sulfate soils in the world is found in the Vietnam Mekong \nRiver Delta, a large low-lying river plain scarcely above sea level, covering 1.6 mil -\nlion ha (4.0 million ac; figure 1) (van Mensvoort 1996; Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture 1978; Huu et al.2022).Acid sulfate soils have high concentrations of aluminum (Al), sulfates (SO\n42–), and iron \n(Fe), and when drained produce sulfuric acid (H\n2SO4) that reduces soil pH below \n4 (van Mensvoort 1996; Huu et al.2022).These metals accumulate in the topsoil during the tropical dry season and are toxic to plant root growth and development and suppress yields making them some of the most difficult soils in which to grow agri -\ncultural crops.Y et, the Vietnam Mekong Delta produces 50% of Vietnam’s rice crop; 95% of rice exports; 65% of aquaculture production; 60% of exported fish; and 70% of the country’s fruit production (Loc et al.2021).One of the keys to acid sulfate soil productivity is water-soil adaptive management that maintains crop-specific balance between reducing and oxidizing conditions in the plant rootzone at critical vegetative, bloom, and fruit development stages (Hanhart et al.1997).More than 50 years ago vast areas of this \ndelta were covered permanently by wet-lands, brackish lagoons, tidal marshes, and mangrove forests.The prevailing winds of the southwest monsoon season brought predictable continuous heavy rains, a consistent 20-fold increase in Mekong River discharge and extensive prolonged flooding inundating lowlands for months (Adamson et al.2009; Taylor 2014; Ngan et al.2018).The monsoon is followed by a dry season when the rains stop and farmers adapt their cropping systems by growing flooded rice (Oryza sativa  L.) varieties in \nthe wet season and digging ditches and canals to drain the floodwater and convey fresh water from the Mekong (Song Tien) \nLois Wright Morton is professor emeritus of \nrural sociology, College of Agriculture and Life \nSciences, Department of Sociology and Crimi-\nnal Justice, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, United States.Nghia Khoi Nguyen is associate \nprofessor in soil and environmental microbiol -\nogy, College of Agriculture, Can Tho University, Can Tho City, Vietnam.M.

What are the benefits of using purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) as a biofertilizer in improving soil health and crop yield in the Mekong Delta's acid sulfate soils?	Purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) have been found to increase phosphorus availability for plant use. They release organic acids during microbial metabolism processes, which increases soil pH and solubilizes Al-P and Fe-P compounds, making phosphorus available for root growth, leaf and flowering, and fruit development. This has shown to improve the growth, yields, and soil health of crops like mango, pineapple, and rice. PNSB solubilizing microbes are active in both aerobic and anerobic environments, making them well suited to the delta’s wet-dry cycles. The use of PNSB also reduces soil legacy phosphorus, improves fertilizer efficiency, and offers an alternative to synthetic fertilizers, potentially reducing the negative impacts of phosphorus loss on water quality.	['90A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4pest and disease resilience (Huu et al.2022; \nNguyen et al.2023).Phosphorus is insoluble (Fe-P) when \nsoil pH is less than 4.However, P solu-bilizing bacteria release organic acids during the microbial metabolism processes and increase soil pH.Evaluations of sev -\neral strains of purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) in the 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) layer of acid sulfate soil have shown that applica -\ntion of R. sphaeroides P solubilizing strains \nincreased P availability for plant use (Luu et al.2022).These bacteria solubilize Al-P and Fe-P compounds, making P avail -\nable for root growth, leaf and flowering, and fruit development.Mango, pineapple, and rice growth, yields, and soil health have shown improvements from the use of PNSB as a biofertilizer.PNSB solubilizing microbes are active in both aerobic and anerobic environments, making them well suited to the delta’s wet-dry cycles.Use of PNSB reduced soil legacy P , improved fer-tilizer efficiency, and offers an alternative to synthetic fertilizers with potential to reduce negative impacts of P loss on water quality (Luu et al.2022).Mekong Delta research on microbial \nbiopesticides for vegetable crops has shown capacity to improve pest, disease, and yield in green onions ( Allium) and an increase in soil \npH after two consecutive crops compared to the control (Nguyen et al.2023).A five-spice biopesticide product of garlic ( Allium sativum  \nL.), chili ( Capsicum), ginger ( Zingiber offici -\nnale), onion, and lemongrass ( Cymbopogon) \nresulted in significant increase in the number of soil bacteria such as beneficial N-fixing bacteria, phosphate (PO\n43–)-solubilizing bac -\nteria, and Si-solubilizing bacteria compared to the control.Stroud and Manefield (2014) found that \nActinobacteria was a major component of acid sulfate soil horizons in Australia.All soil horizons contained d-proteobacteria and a-proteobacteria.Splitting the phylum Chloroflexi into classes revealed that the Chloroflexi class was a dominate group in the acid sulfate soils, and the phy -\nlum Acidobacteria in soil horizons was dominated by Holophagae.The phylum Firmicutes was dominated by the classes Bacilli and Clostridia across all the acid sulfate soils, with the class Nitrospira low in abundance.This is the group that con-tains acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (Leptospirillum sp.), the most important \nphylotype in acid sulfate soils.The abun-dance of this group may be determined by pH due to their limited metabolic capacity (derives energy solely from Fe(II) oxida -\ntion) and adaptability under extremely acidic environments (pH < 4).Although little is known about acid-\ntolerant Fe(II) oxidizers, around 22 are acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing species across four phyla (Bonnefoy and Holmes 2012) with only Firmicutes, and Alicyclobacillus detected in these soils.Chloroflexus was \nhighly abundant in the acid sulfate soil horizons, but its role in Fe cycling is not well understood.However, research from microbial mat zones indicated a positive relationship to zones of enriched Fe(II) oxi -\ndation and the fully sequenced Chloroflexus aurantiacus (Trouwborst et al.2007).More research is needed to understand acid sul -\nfate microorganisms and roles they play in regulating plant nutrient uptake.IMPROVING PLANT SALINITY AND \nALUMINUM TOLERANCE \nSaline and freshwater wetland soils accu -\nmulate plant residues in the soil surface horizon and have a permanently sub-merged reduced gleyed horizon where Fe sulfide minerals (FeS\n2) are present \n(Ponnamperuma 1972).These anaerobic, submerged soils are neutral and can sup -\nport salt-tolerant plants.', '89A\nJULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL. 78, NO. 4 JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONAluminum-tolerant crops like pineap-\nple cultivar (Ananas comosus  [L.] Merrill), \na perennial fruit, tolerate low pH and high \nlevels of soluble soil Al, grow well in low soil fertility, and are fairly well adapted to acid sulfate soils ( Le Van and Masuda 2004).

"""What are the effects of high salt concentrations on plant growth and how can increasing plant available Silicon improve the salt tolerance of crops in saline soils?"""	High salt concentrations can have several detrimental effects on plant growth. They can exceed the osmotic pressure in plant cells, leading to a decreased root capacity to absorb minerals like calcium, potassium, and water. This restricts soil water absorption and inhibits seed germination. Additionally, salinity stress can affect plant metabolic processes, disturb the sodium/calcium ratio, cause nutrition imbalance, and induce oxidation stress, which can lead to decreased photosynthesis and plant productivity.Increasing the availability of silicon (Si) to plants can improve their salt tolerance, particularly in crops like rice, tomatoes, and sugarcane grown in saline soils. Solubilized Si can adjust water uptake by roots, enabling plants to maintain water balance and improve drought tolerance. A small increase in soluble Si by specific microorganisms can significantly enhance salt tolerance in some crops, including improved seed access to soil water, structure of leaf cells, and photosynthetic activity. Certain silicate-solubilizing bacteria have been found to improve rice's salt-tolerant capability, growth, and yield when grown in salt-affected soils.	['However, upland plants have a greater variance in their resis -\ntance to saturated soils and waterlogging.This resistance has been linked to root capacity to oxidize the rhizosphere and ability to withstand short periods of soil submergence (Ponnamperuma 1972).When soil salt solution exceeds the \nosmotic pressure in plant cells, the plant has decreased root capacity to absorb min-erals like Ca, potassium (K), and water.High salt concentrations restrict soil water absorption and inhibit seed germination (Adil et al.2023).Salinity stress on plant metabolic pro-\ncesses affect osmotic processes, specific ion toxicity by disturbing the sodium (Na\n+)/\nCa2+ ratio, nutrition imbalance, and oxi -\ndation stress, which lead to decreased photosynthesis and plant productivity (Adil et al.2023).Increasing plant avail -able Si has been found to improve the salt tolerance of some crops such as rice, tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and sugarcane (Saccharum) grown in saline soils.A growing body of microbial research on Si applications is finding a small increase in soluble Si by specific microorganisms can significantly enhance salt tolerance in some crops including improved seed access to soil water, structure of leaf cells, and photosynthetic activity.Solubilized Si helps adjust water uptake by roots enabling plants to maintain water bal-ance and improve drought tolerance.One silicate-solubilizing bacteria (SSB) study on rice cultivars grown in salt-affected soil under greenhouse conditions in two consecutive seasons evaluated the efficacy of five SSB, Ochrobactrum ciceri TCM_39 (TCM_39), Microbacterium neimengense \nMCM_15 (MCM_15), Klebsiella aerogenes LCT_01 (LCT_01), Citrobacter freundii \nRTTV_12 (RTTV_12), and Olivibacter jilunii PTST_30 (PTST_30), isolated from \nbamboo, sugarcane, rice planted soils, earthworm intestine, and earthworm feces as bacterial sources (Nguyen and Tran 2023).Researchers found SSB improved rice salt-tolerant capability, growth, and yield when grown in salt-affected soils.Biochemical and physiological research \nevaluating salt and Al tolerance in pineapple cultivars is finding significant differences in detection of Al in the soil and accumu -\nlation of Al in roots among cultivars (Le Van and Masuda 2004).Low Al accumula -\ntion in roots accompanied by increased Al tolerance suggests an Al exclusion mecha -\nnism in the roots triggered by exposure to soil Al (LeVan and Masuda 2004).This type of research lays the groundwork for \nimproved plant breeding and technolo -\ngies that target development of plants with root systems able to exclude Al and mini-mize salt impacts on plant water uptake.These are the kind of innovations that \nwill be needed to simultaneously manage water-soil relationships in acid sulfate soils, improve agricultural capacities to pro-duce food and nutrition, enable farmers to make a living, and ensure the integrity of unique delta ecosystems.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', 'The depth to the acid sulfate hori -\nzon, depth to water table during growing season, the role of capillary rise, the spe -\ncific crop grown, and the time and cost of labor influence the height of the con -\nstructed raised beds.Evapotranspiration will pull water upwards during the dry season, potentially leaving behind Na\n2SO4 \nand other salts.The higher the raised bed, the thicker the zone of leaching will be and distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, thus increasing the available soil volume for roots.Freshly excavated soil deposited as \nridges or shaped into raised beds create a network of macropores between soil clods that enable water to flow through the top -\nsoil and bypass the unsaturated soil matrix.Water moving through the macropores of newly constructed raised beds can quickly Figure 2\nThis sluice gate in Soc Trang Province, Vietnam, connects a main canal to the \nSouth China Sea and controls saltwater tidal inflow and flooding outflow.Open sluice gates allow fields to drain after heavy rains and flooding and are closed during high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to irrigate agricultural fields.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation']

"""What strategies can be used to manage the harmful effects of soil salinity in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, as mentioned in the context?"""	Several strategies are mentioned for managing the harmful effects of soil salinity in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These include modifying the delta floodwater control system to encourage farmers to diversify their cropping systems and be more attentive to the environmental impacts of agriculture. The Vietnam Resolution 120/2017/NQ-CP promotes living with floods, uncertainty adaptation, and nature-based approaches for addressing climate change and upstream development. Farmers are encouraged to seek innovative water management and drainage approaches, adapt cropping systems to changing soil-water conditions, and build on their accumulated local knowledge and scientific findings. Understanding the properties and processes of acid sulfate soils, developing climate-flexible crops and management systems, and increasing crop genetic tolerances to Al and salt concentrations are also foundational to effective agricultural adaptation. Large-scale irrigation projects have been undertaken to construct canals to channel fresh water from the Mekong and Bassac rivers to reduce water and soil salinity. Water control projects consist of high dyke and flood control, salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture, and salinity control in brackish water aquaculture. Canals are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements, and sluice gates are used to control saltwater intrusion.

What are the implications of intensifying saline water intrusion and drought in the Mekong Delta according to the studies mentioned in the context?	Intensifying saline water intrusion and drought in the Mekong Delta can exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease. This allows saline water to move further inland. The landward movement of saltwater alters soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. This can have implications for agriculture, as it can make the acidic delta soils less productive for crops and make the shallow groundwater salty and unsafe for cooking or drinking. Additionally, the onset of the dry season is accompanied by receding waters and shifting salinity concentrations in the waterways, which can also affect agriculture and water supply.

"""What are the implications of saltwater intrusion on the soil chemistry in agricultural fields in the Mekong Delta, as discussed in the report?"""	Saltwater intrusion, which is the landward movement of saltwater, significantly alters the soil geochemistry in agricultural fields in the Mekong Delta. It changes the soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. This intrusion can be exacerbated during drought periods when freshwater flow rates decrease, allowing saline water to move further inland. The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, and increases FeS2 buildup. These changes can lead to reduced agricultural productivity, degrade surface water quality, and make aquatic ecosystems vulnerable.

"""How does the increase in salinity concentration affect the productivity of crops such as rice and sweet potatoes in the Mekong Delta?"""	An increase in salinity concentration negatively impacts the productivity of crops in the Mekong Delta. Specifically, when salinity increases by 1 gram per liter, it reduces the yield of rice by 0.197 quintal per hectare and sweet potato yield by 2.809 quintals per hectare. Furthermore, the yield of major crops in the region, including rice, maize, and sweet potato, is also affected by the lowest river water levels or severe water shortages in the dry season, which further reduce crop yields.

"""What are the effects of increased salinity on the growth and yield of rice, and how does it influence the use of land in agricultural practices?"""	Increased salinity has a negative impact on crop yield, specifically on rice. When salinity increases by 1 gram/liter, it reduces the yield. This can influence the use of land in agricultural practices as areas with higher salinity may become less suitable for growing certain crops, leading to potential changes in land use and farming strategies.

"""What is the significance of a p-value less than 0.05 and how does it determine the use of Fixed Effects Model (FEM) or Random Effects Model (REM) in analyzing the impact of salinity intrusion and climate change?"""	A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected, meaning there is a significant existence of individual effects and a correlation between the error term and the independent variable. In such a case, the Fixed Effects Model (FEM) is used. On the other hand, if the p-value is not less than 0.05, the Random Effects Model (REM) is used. These models are used to analyze the factors affecting the productivity of rice, corn, and sweet potatoes in the context of salinity intrusion and climate change.

"""How has the phenomenon of salinity intrusion negatively affected the yield of rice and sweet potatoes in the Mekong Delta region from 2010 to 2019, and what is the impact of an increase in salinity concentration on these crops?"""	The phenomenon of salinity intrusion has negatively affected the yield of rice and sweet potatoes in the Mekong Delta region from 2010 to 2019. The research showed that an increase in salinity has a detrimental impact on crop yield. Specifically, when salinity increases by 1 gram/liter, it reduces the rice yield by 0.197 quintal/ha and the sweet potato yield by 2.809 quintals/ha. Furthermore, the yield of these crops also depends on the lowest river water levels or severe water shortages in the dry season, which further reduce crop yields.

"""How does an increase in salinity affect crop yield in the Mekong River Delta?"""	An increase in salinity negatively impacts crop yield in the Mekong River Delta.

"""What are the nutritional values and benefits of growing Sacha Inchi in Vietnam according to the context?"""	Sacha Inchi is a long-term crop with a quick harvest time and high seasonality. Its cultivation, harvesting, preservation, and processing techniques are relatively simple. The Sacha Inchi seeds are highly nutritious, with an oil content of 41.4% and protein content of 24.7%. The fatty acid composition in Sacha Inchi oil includes a-linolenic (50.8%) and linoleic (33.4%), with the majority being unsaturated fatty acids (97.2%), and lesser amounts of free fatty acids (1.2%), and phospholipids (0.8%). The seeds are also rich in iodine, vitamin A, and vitamin E, and are the richest in omega 3 among plants. However, the current yield of Sacha Inchi seeds in Vietnam is relatively low. Studies have been conducted on cultivation methods, with one experiment involving planting densities of 1,111; 1,667 and 2,500 plants/ha. The highest yield was achieved with a planting density of 3,333 plants/ha and a fertilization level of 2 kg/hole of manure + 70 (N + P2O5 + K2O) kg/ha. The first crop yield and the first year yield were highest at a planting density of 5,555 plants/ha with the same fertilization level.

Alternative crops that can be implemented to supplement the loss of rice income due to inland saline intrusion during the dry season in the Mekong River Delta include familiar crops like maize and soybean, as well as novel crops like quinoa and cowpea. These crops were identified based on factors such as salt tolerance, timing and efficiency of water use, ability to grow in the dry season, tolerance to pests and diseases, labor intensiveness, and marketability.In terms of soil management practices, techniques like mulching, raised beds, and soil water monitoring can be used to decrease salinity stress and improve water use efficiency. Mulching with organic materials or plastic coverings can maintain soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and slow capillary rise, thus reducing the concentration of surface salt. Soil moisture monitoring can help producers develop an irrigation schedule that will improve water use efficiency and minimize the amount of saline water applied. These practices can provide farmers with production options for saline affected areas during the dry season.

What measures have contributed to the increase in rice production area from 52% to 91% of the Delta area in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta?	The increase in rice production area from 52% to 91% of the Delta area in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta can be attributed to several measures. These include flood control measures, advancements in fertiliser use, implementation of mechanisation, and the adoption of high yielding rice varieties.	['Flood control measures (Marchand et al., 2011 ), advancements in \nfertiliser use, implementation of mechanisation and the adoption of high \nyielding rice varieties saw the rice production area increase from 52% to \n91% of the Delta area (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).A combination of climatic, \nsoil and hydrological conditions allow farmers to produce up to three \nFig.1.Map of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, its provinces, and its location within Vietnam (insert) (map adapted from Trieu and Phong (2015) .B.

What are the impacts of saline intrusion on agricultural production and farmer livelihoods in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	Saline intrusion in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) in Vietnam can have significant negative impacts on agricultural production and farmer livelihoods. This is because the MRD is a region heavily reliant on agriculture, with about two-thirds of the area dedicated to agricultural production, accounting for approximately 40% of the regional GDP and providing livelihoods for over 75% of the people. The economy of the MRD is particularly exposed to any negative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intrusion. Rice production, which is fundamental to the economic function and livelihoods of the people in the MRD, is especially vulnerable. For instance, in 2019, paddy rice production was 0.6 Mt. less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather. Therefore, saline intrusion can potentially lead to significant rice losses, affecting income opportunities for farmers and impacting the overall economy of the MRD.

What are the contributing factors to saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how do they affect the region?	The contributing factors to saline intrusion in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) include the development of irrigation infrastructure, changes to upstream river flows, a changing climate causing rising sea levels, tidal influxes, and drought. These factors have created a link between the ocean and agricultural regions, making the MRD, which has a marginal elevation above sea level, vulnerable to oceanic saline water intrusion. This intrusion has damaging effects on agricultural production, farmer livelihoods, and economic stability. It has been identified as the most prominent hazard to agricultural production for farming households. Saline intrusion is also causing soil salinisation, impacting rice production and decreasing long-term productive capacity as soil salts accumulate over time. In 2020, parts of the MRD declared emergencies with drought and salinity affecting over 100,000 ha of rice crop production as salt water intruded ~60 –70 km inland. It's predicted that salt concentrations in 2050 will exceed 4 g L up to 60 km upriver from the ocean, subjecting inland areas to severe salinisation.

Van Kien et al., 2020 ) allowed for the intensi -\nfication of rice production (Nguyen et al., 2020b ), it also created a link \nbetween the ocean and agricultural regions.Because the MRD has a \nmarginal elevation above sea level, it is vulnerable to oceanic saline \nwater intrusion.This is exacerbated by changes to upstream river flows \nand a changing climate causing rising sea levels, tidal influxes, and \ndrought (Wassmann et al., 2004 ; Trieu and Phong, 2015 ; Hoa et al., \n2019 ).The contributing factors to dry season saline intrusion and the \nassociated effects these have on the MRD are highlighted in Table 1.Salinity has been identified as the most prominent hazard to agri-\ncultural production for farming households (Renaud et al., 2015 ) with \nnational authorities suggesting the irrigation threshold for salinity \nregarded as being detrimental to rice production is 4 g L\x001 (Le et al., \n2007 ).Saline intrusion has damaging effects on agricultural production, \nfarmer livelihoods and economic stability (Phung et al., 2020 ).In 2000, \nthe Vietnamese government recognised the need to diversify agricul -\ntural production in order to meet food security demands and thus \nchanges were made to the land use policy (Nguyen et al., 2020c ).This \nallowed for the diversification into rice shrimp farming along coastal \nareas that utilised saline water and provided high economic returns, \nhowever at the adverse cost of rapid soil salinisation.Over 1.2 million ha \nof the southernmost point of the MRD is now classified as salt affected as \na result of rice shrimp farming (Thi Nhung et al., 2019 ).Increasingly \nworrisome is evidence of saline intrusion occurring in inland provinces \nfurther up the Mekong traditionally not affected by salinity (Fig.3) \n(Phung et al., 2020 ).Despite the installation of over 21,000 sluice gates \nalong the 92,000 km of canals of the MRD (Marchand et al., 2011 ), sa-\nline water is impacting rice production and decreasing long-term pro-\nductive capacity as soil salts accumulate over time (Renaud et al., 2015 ).In 2020, parts of the MRD including Soc Trang and Tra Vinh Provinces \ndeclared emergencies with drought and salinity affecting over 100,000 \nha of rice crop production as salt water intruded ~60 –70 km inland (MARD, 2020 ).The extent of saline intrusion over time is summarised in Fig.4 where \nintrusion occurred prior to sluice gate control (1998), was constrained to \ncoastal areas in 2010, however breached sluice gate control measures in \n2016 and 2020 and intruded far into inland provinces affecting over 2 \nmillion ha (Loc et al., 2021 ).It has been predicted that salt concentra -\ntions in 2050 will exceed 4 g L\x001 up to 60 km upriver from the ocean (Vu \net al., 2018 ), meaning that inland areas like Can Tho will be subjected to \nthe same severe salinisation currently observed in coastal areas.In response to inland saline intrusion, farmers have varied the time of \nsowing based on seasonal predictions (Phung et al., 2020 ) in an effort to \nadvance crop development and avoid salinity damage at the critical \nstages of anthesis and grain filling (Fig.4).Efforts have also been made \nFig.2.The three phase (He Thu, Thu Dong and Dong Xuan) rice cropping calendar of the Mekong River Delta.Also shown are the months of the rainy and \ndry seasons.Table 1 \nThe contributing factors causing dry season saline intrusion and the conse -\nquential effects on the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam.', 'Nguyen, B., Hay, N., Due, L.A., Hung, B.N., 2016.Viet Nam agricultural machinery \nindustry.AMA, Agricult.Mech.Asia, Africa nd Latin America 47, 67–70.Nguyen, B., Nguyen, V., Lanh, N., Bui, T.-A., 2020a.Mekong River Delta agricultural \nmechanization development: case study in Vinh Long Province, Viet Nam.Int.J. \nAdv.Sci.Eng.Inform.Technol.10, 736.Nguyen, K., Nguyen, H., Cramb, R., 2020b.Trends in Rice-Based Farming Systems in the \nMekong Delta .Nguyen, Q.H., Tran, D.D., Dang, K.K., Korbee, D., Pham, L.D.M.H., Vu, L.T., Luu, T.T., \nHo, L.H., Nguyen, P.T., Ngo, T., Nguyen, D.T.K., Wyatt, A., Van Aalst, M., Tran, T.A., \nSea, W.B., 2020c.Land-use dynamics in the Mekong delta: from national policy to \nlivelihood sustainability.Sustain.Dev.28, 448–467.Otsuka, K., Fan, S., 2001.Agricultural Development: New Perspectives in a Changing \nWorld.Washington International Food Policy Research Institute .Oumarou, H., Falalou, H., Taya, B., Mahamane, S., Vadez, V., 2015.Water use, \ntranspiration efficiency and yield in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and peanut \n(Arachis hypogaea) across water regimes.Crop Pasture Sci.66.Oveisi, M., 2017.Cardinal temperatures for seed germination of three quinoa \n(Chenopodium quinoa Willd.)cultivars.Iran.J.

What measures have been suggested to mitigate the effects of saline intrusion on rice crops in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Several measures have been suggested to mitigate the effects of saline intrusion on rice crops in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These include the identification of suitable alternative crops to replace dry season rice in saline affected areas. Familiar crops like maize and soybean, as well as novel crops to the Mekong River Delta such as quinoa and cowpea, were explored as potential options. Management practices like mulching, raised beds, and soil water monitoring can decrease salinity stress and improve water use efficiency. Other options include surface soil mulches and plastic coverings to maintain soil moisture and reduce salinity damage to plants, and the use of drainage and seed preparation techniques to improve plant establishment and yield. These combined strategies provide farmers with production options for saline affected areas during the dry season.

What are some alternative crops that have shown tolerance to high salinity levels, which could potentially be grown in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam during periods of saline intrusion?	Some alternative crops that have shown tolerance to high salinity levels include cowpea, quinoa, mustard greens, and maize. Cowpea appears to osmotically adjust by accumulating greater concentrations of Na+ in their roots during vegetative stages to minimise salinity damage. Quinoa, due to its halophytic nature, can withstand high levels of salinity and has shown to have increased biomass and yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline conditions. Mustard greens have demonstrated an overexpression of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) associated with an increased sequestration of Na+ in roots. Maize plants have been found to have increased concentrations of proline, an osmoprotectant that plays a critical role in counteracting osmotic stress, under salt-stressed conditions. These crops could potentially be grown in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam during periods of saline intrusion.

Jacobsen et al., 2003 ).Characterisa -\ntion of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) involved in salt sensory \nmechanisms has occurred in quinoa (Maughan et al., 2009 ) with the \nplant demonstrating the ability to rapidly sequester salt into the vacuole \nto prevent the accumulation of cytoplasmic Na+(Cai and Gao, 2020 ).An \noverexpression of the SOS1 gene was also found in saline tolerant \nmustard greens (Brassica juncea) that was associated with an increased sequestration of Na+in roots (Singh et al., 2019 ).Proline is an osmo -\nprotectant that plays a critical role in counteracting osmotic stress and \nincreased concentrations of proline have been found in salt-stressed \nmaize (Zea mays) plants (Kaya et al., 2010 ).Whilst alternative crops have differing cellular physiological salt \ntolerance mechanisms, salinity also affects the agronomy and conse -\nquential yield in different ways.Seedlings are generally sensitive to salt \nexposure; however, seedlings of alternative crops are planted when soil \nsalinity levels are low.For this review, germination and seedling toler-\nance is irrelevant and will not be further investigated.Priority lays with \nan alternative crops ability to withstand salinity exposure during vege-\ntative and reproductive growth.Ultimately, the precedence is a crops \nability to produce marketable yield in a saline environment.Table 2 \nsummarises the yield response of alternative crop options at varying salt \nconcentrations including a relative ranking.Quinoa proves very salt tolerant and successfully produces grain \n(Hussain et al., 2020 ) at similar concentrations recorded in canals dur-\ning extreme salinisation events in the MRD (Eslami et al., 2019 ), whilst \ncowpea and mustard greens demonstrate high tolerance.The successful \ninoculation of cowpea played a significant role in the crops ability to \nwithstand increased salt concentrations (Manaf and Zayed, 2015 ).The \nreproductive phases of maize are affected by salinity with decreased \nkernel set and grain weight (Kaya et al., 2010 ) and consequentially, is \nranked lower than cowpea and mustard greens.Soybean has a low \ntolerance and ranks similarly to rice, although salt-tolerant soybean \nvarieties can increase photosynthetic rates to generate ~47% greater \ngrain yields than salt-sensitive varieties (He et al., 2016 ).', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n2Numerous biophysical, environmental, and \nsocioeconomic factors are identified that help \ndetermine an alternative crops suitability \nManagement practices including mulching, \nraised beds and soil water monitoring can \ndecrease salinity stress and improve water use \nefficiency \nCombining alternative crops and management \npractices provide farmers with production \noptions for saline affected areas during the dry \nseason RESULTS: Familiar crops in Vietnam (e.g., maize, soybean), as well as novel crops to the MRD (e.g., quinoa, \ncowpea) were explored as potential options to replace dry season rice.Management options including surface soil \nmulches and plastic coverings help maintain soil moisture and reduce salinity damage to plants, and the use of \ndrainage and seed preparation techniques can improve plant establishment and yield.Factors contributing to the \nsuccess of alternative crops include salt tolerance, timing and efficiency of water use, ability to grow in the dry \ngrowing season, tolerance to pests and diseases, labour intensiveness and the crops ’ marketability.SIGNIFICANCE: The identification of suitable alternative crops to replace dry season rice in saline affected areas \nof the MRD, combined with management practices like mulching and soil moisture monitoring, could provide \nfarmers with income opportunities to offset rice losses.Documenting the factors contributing to successful crop \ndiversification can assist with decision-making and support initiatives among farmers, agribusiness, and gov-\nernment agencies.1.Introduction: The Mekong River Delta and the central role of \nrice cropping \nThis review focuses on the increasing salinisation of the Mekong \nDelta in Vietnam and the search for alternative crops to rice.Focusing on \nthe primary bio-physical aspects, the review has sections on: the Mekong \nRiver Delta and the central role of rice cropping, saline intrusion, \nalternative crops to rice, and in-field management practices to mitigate \nthe impacts of saline intrusion.The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is in the south of Vietnam where the \nMekong River flows through a network of distributaries before reaching \nthe East Sea (Fig.1).The Mekong is the longest river in Southeast Asia \nand originates in the Tibetan Plateau before flowing through China, \nMyanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam;

it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.', 'However, the higher water \nrequirement of maize and soybean may limit the crops suitability for \nlarger scale growth as an alternative to rice.Another possible alternative crop is quinoa;

What crops are more suitable replacements for rice in terms of water use and salinity tolerance in the Mekong River Delta's dry season?	Crops such as maize, soybean, quinoa, and cowpea are potential replacements for rice in the Mekong River Delta's dry season. Quinoa, in particular, is highly drought-resistant and has a low water requirement, making it suitable for the dry season. However, its sensitivity to waterlogging would require careful management. Cowpea has also been successfully grown in dry season conditions similar to those in the Mekong River Delta.

What are some alternative crops to rice that can tolerate the conditions in the Mekong Delta during the dry season, and what are their specific requirements or limitations?	Alternative crops to rice that can tolerate the conditions in the Mekong Delta during the dry season include quinoa, cowpea, mustard greens, maize, and soybean. These crops have a shorter growing duration and can mature before the peak in salinity occurs, making them suitable for the dry season. However, they must also be able to tolerate high temperatures that occur throughout the dry season. In terms of disease and pest susceptibility, an ideal replacement crop should have a relatively low susceptibility. Diseases and pests can often be controlled by integrated pest management (IPM) options involving either chemical application or biocontrol methods. For instance, downy mildew is a prominent fungal disease in quinoa, but the breeding of downy mildew tolerant quinoa varieties has significantly decreased fungal impacts in these production systems. Soybean is also affected by fungal diseases, but breeding of tolerant Vietnamese soybean can reduce disease susceptibility.In terms of labor and machinery, ideally, alternative dry season replacement crops would be capable of being grown using the same rice-producing equipment already available to farmers, without major modification. Unlike rice which requires anaerobic soil conditions, alternative crops will generally require aerobic soil conditions for growth.

damage to rice crops (Phan et al., 2010 ) and \nconsequently, farmers are familiar with the use of chemical control \nmethods.A farmer survey conducted in the MRD identified 64 different \nchemicals that were used in rice-shrimp farming systems (Berg, 2001 ).Of these, 25% were herbicides, 25% fungicides and the remaining 50% \nwere insecticides.The survey also identified a strong understanding

favour \nfungal spore development.Despite a lower disease pressure in the dry \nseason, the identification of alternative crops that have undertaken \nadvanced breeding through the selection of

diseases with up to \n20% yield reductions occurring in plants infected with powdery mildew \n(Dunn and Gaynor, 2020 ) although breeding of tolerant Vietnamese \nsoybean can reduce disease susceptibility (Ho Manh et al., 2016 ).Powdery mildew has also been identified in Vietnamese Indian mustard \ngreens (Tam et al., 2016 ) with evidence of tolerance in Indian cultivars \n(Nanjundan et

What alternative crops with shorter growing duration and tolerance to high temperatures could be suitable for replacing rice in the dry season in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, considering the peak in salinity and the risk of diseases and pests?	Quinoa, cowpea, and mustard greens are potential alternative crops that could replace rice in the dry season in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These crops have a shorter growing duration and would mature before the peak in salinity occurs. They also have a tolerance to high temperatures, which is essential for successful growth in the dry season. However, it's important to consider their susceptibility to diseases and pests. For instance, quinoa is susceptible to downy mildew, a fungal disease that can cause significant yield losses, but breeding of downy mildew tolerant quinoa varieties has helped decrease these impacts. Mustard greens and cowpea also have their own disease and pest pressures, but integrated pest management and breeding of disease-tolerant varieties can help manage these risks.

this tolerates a wide \nrange of temperatures (5–35 ◦C) (Oveisi, 2017 ) and is highly drought \nresistant with a low water requirement (Algosaibi et al., 2017 ; Telahigue \net al., 2017 ).Whilst its growth is not common in Vietnam, it has been \nsuccessfully grown in conditions similar to the MRD dry season (Choukr- \nAllah et al., 2016 ).However, quinoa ’s sensitivity to waterlogging \n(Gonz ´alez et al., 2009 ) would require careful management following its \ngrowth after a rice crop.Implementation of raised bed systems might \nsuccessfully alleviate waterlogging issues (Bakker et al., 2010 ).Mustard greens is affected by heat stress (35/15 ◦C) at early flow-\nering stages although biomass production is unaffected at moderate \ntemperatures (day/night) of 28/15 ◦C (Angadi et al., 2000 ).Cowpea has \nbeen successfully grown in the dry season of Niger where temperatures \nFig.6.An overlay of dry season canal salinity concentrations (average of Soc Trang and Dai Ngai) with average monthly rainfall and crop growing duration for \nquinoa, cowpea, mustard greens, maize, soybean and rice (Salinity data from Ratering Arntz (2018) .B.

it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.', 'Bed formation may become a critical part of field preparation prior to sowing for some \nalternative crops, particularly those with limited waterlogging tolerance \nlike quinoa (Gonz ´alez et al., 2009 ).In 2010, the use of mechanisation to \nprepare land in the MRD was 70% of rice farm production area and over \n60% of rice was harvested using a combine harvester (Takeshima et al., \n2018 ).The seeds of identified alternative crops can be sown via direct \nplacement into the soil, either by hand or implement.These crops do not \nrequire transplanting like rice, and this reduces one labour component \nfrom the system.For some crops harvesting can be performed using rice \nharvesters; approximately one harvester exists per 50 ha of cropping \nproduction land in the MRD (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).Minor modifications \nto the header front, sieves, fan and rotor speeds to suit each crop can be \nmade to optimise harvest yields.Processing equipment is common on \nfarm including mechanical corn shelling machines (Dang et al., 2004 ) or \ndryers for moist grain (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).Some identified alternative crops including maize (Rashid et al., \n2013 ) and soybean (Ho Manh et al., 2016 ) are already grown in the MRD \nwith farmers aware of the production cycle and labour required.How-\never, the production of other alternative crops in the MRD dry season \nwill be influenced by the successful adaption and use of available \nmechanisation (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).3.6.Profitability and availability of a market chain \nThe production of an alternative dry season crop must be financially \nviable for farmers.The shift from double- to triple-rice production \ninitially improved the profitability of rice monoculture systems in the \nMRD, but required significant increases in inputs, particularly fertilisers \nand pesticides.Over time, as the cost of these inputs has increased, the \nprofit margin of triple-rice production has gradually decreased \n(WorldBank, 2016 ).The cost of pesticides and fertilisers was recently \nestimated at 50–60% of total production costs in the MRD, while the \nprofitability of triple-rice systems relative to double-rice systems had \ndeclined significantly, with total yields in some cases less than in double- \nrice systems (Tran et al., 2018b ).Viability includes having an available market to trade produce.Farmers in the MRD are familiar with identifying new market chains \nwhen adapting to alternative farming practices, as evidenced by the \nimplementation of rice and shrimp farming (Dang, 2020 ).In addition, \nMRD farmers have already established market chains for some alterna -\ntive crops including maize and soybean.In a 2004 survey, farmers re-\nported that large quantities of maize could be sold via traders and \ncollectors from the farm gate which saved on transportation labour and \ncosts (Dang et al., 2004 ).Further opportunities for selling produce at \nvillage markets provides additional income to famers.An absence of \nmarket chain exists for crops like quinoa in the MRD, however the global \nquinoa market is rapidly expanding (Alandia et al., 2020 ) with over 120 \ncountries now growing it (Bazile et al., 2016 ).The identified alternative \ncrops are all directly consumable products for human or livestock and do \nnot require large amounts of processing like a fibre crop.This provides \nMRD farmers with the opportunity to sell directly to traders or con-\nsumers to maximise economic return.Export opportunities also exists, \nbut may require further development of relevant value chains (Otsuka \nand Fan, 2001 ).3.7.Overall suitability \nThe combination of factors discussed above contribute to an overall \nsuitability scale (Fig.7).This relative scale includes rice as a comparison \ncrop and can be used to examine the suitability of a range of different \ncrops not mentioned above or adapted for a different scenario or loca-\ntion.For the purpose of this review, greater emphasis is placed on a \ncrop ’s physiological suitability to the MRD dry season, as without the \nability to tolerate salinity or grow with minimal water, the adaption \nrequired to existing machinery or development of a market cannot \noccur.Using a ‘traffic light ’ framework such as that presented in Fig.']

Some suitable alternative crops that can be grown in the Mekong River Delta to mitigate the effects of saline intrusion include familiar crops like maize and soybean, as well as novel crops like quinoa and cowpea.

Dong et al., 2008 ), however this is not an issue in the MRD.The \nmajority of plastic mulches are polyethylene based and non- \nbiodegradable, thus the environmental implications of using plastic \nmulch must be carefully considered (Kasirajan and Ngouajio, 2012 ).Research into biodegradable plastic mulches and microorganisms that \ndecompose plastic is still developing (Shah and Wu, 2020 ).4.1.2.Soil moisture monitoring \nFlooded rice production has dominated the MRD and thus there is a \nlack of knowledge regarding irrigation schedules for upland crops.Monitoring soil moisture throughout the dry season can help producers \ndevelop an irrigation schedule that will improve WUE and minimise the \namount of saline water applied.Tensiometers can be an effective tool to \nmonitor soil moisture and apply irrigation at the required time to \nmaintain adequate soil moisture, although they are not readily available \nto producers in the MRD.Successful monitoring of soil moisture in the \nMRD is dependent on affordable and easy to use devices.The Chameleon \nsoil moisture sensor is a cost-effective device that provides real-time, \nFig.7.A relative suitability scale for assessing a crops suitability as an alternative crop for growth in the MRD dry season using several physiological (salt tolerance, \nwater use (mm), water use efficiency (WUE), growth duration, temperature tolerance (Temp), pest and disease tolerance and socioeconomic factors (use of existing \nmachinery (Machinery) and existing market).Greater emphasis is placed on factors with larger circles.B.

What are some of the benefits and potential challenges of using the Chameleon soil moisture sensor and effective drainage systems to manage soil salinisation in the Mekong River Delta?	The Chameleon soil moisture sensor provides real-time information about a crop's soil moisture status, which can help farmers implement irrigation schedules based on quantitative data. This can save significant amounts of water by reducing the frequency and duration of watering. The sensor also promotes social benefits among farmer groups by generating conversation and awareness of improved irrigation schedules. When used with mulching and alternative crops that have high water use efficiency and saline tolerance, the Chameleon sensor can potentially limit soil salinisation by reducing the frequency of use of saline irrigation water.Effective drainage systems, on the other hand, can minimise salinity damage to plants by removing excess saline water. Raised bed systems provide adequate drainage options for waterlogging sensitive plants and can help reduce the effects of salinity. In Bangladesh, a raised bed system combined with mulch produced about 70% more potato tubers than flat ground with no mulch. The use of drainage pipes can have similar benefits to raised beds. Sub-surface drainage is known to remove excess saline water and helps reduce long-term soil salinisation.However, there are challenges to consider. The labour intensiveness of implementing raised beds and drainage systems must be taken into account. Mechanisation is increasing in popularity in the Mekong River Delta, but the availability of machinery may vary. For instance, a recent farmer survey indicated that one rotary tiller with a walking tractor exists for every 7 hectares of rice produced.	['Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n10easily gathered information regarding a crops soil moisture status.The \nsensor measures the water tension in the soil which negates the need to \ncalibrate for soil type (Stirzaker et al., 2017 ).Three coloured lights \nindicate soil moisture status with blue as ‘wet’ (0 to \x0022 kPa), green as \n‘moist ’ (\x0022 to \x0050 kPa) and red indicates ‘dry’ (>\x0050 kPa) soil.Use of \nthe Chameleon sensor has allowed Tanzanian farmers to implement \nirrigation schedules based on quantitative data that saves significant \namounts of water by reducing the frequency and duration of watering \n(Mdemu et al., 2020 ).The adoption of the Chameleon has also created \nsocial benefits among farmer groups by generating conversation and \nawareness of improved irrigation schedules (Moyo et al., 2020 ).The \nimplementation of the Chameleon soil moisture sensor in the MRD \nmight limit soil salinisation by reducing the frequency of use of saline \nirrigation water.Used in conjunction with mulching and alternative \ncrops that have a high water use efficiency (WUE) and saline tolerance, \nthe Chameleon might provide a suitable management option for opti-\nmising the implementation of alternative crops in the MRD dry season.4.2.Drainage \nSalinity damage to plants can be minimised by removing excess sa-\nline water via effective drainage.Increased shoot Na+and Cl\x00concen -\ntrations can occur due to an interaction between waterlogging and \nsalinity (Barrett-Lennard, 2003 ).Waterlogged rice paddy may also have \nnegative impacts on the subsequent emergence and establishment of \nalternative crops sown at the end of the rainy He-Thu season.Raised bed \nsystems provide adequate drainage options for waterlogging sensitive \nplants and can help reduce the effects of salinity.In Bangladesh, a raised \nbed system combined with mulch produced ~70% more potato tubers \nthan flat ground with no mulch (Islam et al., 2018 ).The use of drainage \npipes can have similar benefits to raised beds (Feng et al., 2017 ).Sub-\nsurface drainage is known to remove excess saline water and helps \nreduce long-term soil salinisation (Smedema et al., 2000 ).Whilst the \nbenefits of raised beds and drainage in reducing soil salinity levels are \nabundant, labour intensiveness must be considered when recommend -\ning their use in the MRD.Mechanisation is increasing in popularity in \nthe MRD with a recent farmer survey indicating that one rotary tiller \nwith a walking tractor exists for every 7 ha of rice produced (Nguyen \net al., 2020a ).As an example of mechanisation, over half a million tractors were used in agricultural production in Vietnam in 2013 \n(Nguyen et al., 2016 ).4.3.Seed preparation \nSeed priming is a pre-sowing treatment that can help alleviate the \nnegative effects of salinity where seeds are soaked for up to 12 h in \nsolutions including NaCl, CaCl 2 and KCl prior to sowing (Chen et al., \n2021 ; Ashraf and Foolad, 2005 ).This simple technique has improved \ngermination, plant establishment and plant growth by initiating imbi-\nbition and activating metabolic processes (Ashraf and Foolad, 2005 ).Success across a multitude of crops has been reported with improved \ngermination rates in maize (Ashraf and Rauf, 2001 ), sorghum (Chen \net al., 2021 ) and quinoa (Yang et al., 2018 ).However, alternative crops \nin the MRD are planted at the end of the wet season when soil salinity is \nlow, thus seed priming is of less relevance.An alternative seed preparation technique that mitigates the nega-\ntive effects of soil salinity is the use of plant growth-promoting bacterial \n(PGPB) endophytes (Ali et al., 2014 ).', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n9suitable alternative crop would have more green, less orange and min-\nimal to no red.This assessment framework highlights several potentially \nsuitable alternative crops including quinoa, cowpea and mustard greens, \ndespite the lack of a current market.A crop like soybean that has rela-\ntively poor salt tolerance and high-water use is less suitable despite an \nexisting market.It is important to note that various crops may suit \ndifferent regions of the MRD where water scarcity or saline intrusion \nmay vary (Tran et al., 2018a ).4.Alternative management practices \nImplementing various management techniques can provide a cost- \neffective way to reduce the effects of salinity and maximise production \nof dry season alternative crops.Conserving soil moisture, monitoring \nirrigation, and establishing effective drainage are well proven manage -\nment options that can be used in conjunction with a suitable replace -\nment crop.4.1.Soil moisture conservation \nImplementing management techniques that retain soil moisture can \ndecrease the need for frequent irrigation and, where the irrigation water \nis saline, reduce a crop ’s consequent exposure to salinity.This can be \ndone via the use of soil surface mulches or soil moisture monitoring \ndevices.4.1.1.Mulching \nMulching with organic materials is an effective way to maintain soil moisture (Abd El-Mageed et al., 2016 ), reduce evaporation (Fu et al., \n2018 ), slow capillary rise and reduce the concentration of surface salt \n(Song et al., 2020 ).Straw mulch is a cheap, biodegradable soil covering \nmethod that has been used by many producers throughout Asia to limit \nthe effects of salinity.The benefits of mulch in relation to soil salinity, \nsoil moisture and yield are summarised in Table 3.Plastic coverings can decrease evaporation, increase yields, decrease \npesticide runoff (Steinmetz et al., 2016 ) and assist with the adverse ef-\nfects of transient salinity (Barrett-Lennard et al., 2021 ).Plastic mulches \nare beneficial for increasing soil temperatures in cool climates (Lin et al., \n2016 ;

What are some of the alternative crops and management techniques that can be used to mitigate the effects of dry season salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta?	Some of the alternative crops that can be used to mitigate the effects of dry season salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta include maize, soybean, quinoa, and cowpea. These crops were explored as potential options to replace dry season rice. Management techniques that can be used include mulching and soil moisture monitoring. Mulching with organic materials or plastic coverings can maintain soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and decrease the concentration of surface salt. Soil moisture monitoring can help producers develop an irrigation schedule that will improve water use efficiency and minimize the amount of saline water applied. Other management options include surface soil mulches and plastic coverings to maintain soil moisture and reduce salinity damage to plants, and the use of drainage and seed preparation techniques to improve plant establishment and yield.

it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n9suitable alternative crop would have more green, less orange and min-\nimal to no red.This assessment framework highlights several potentially \nsuitable alternative crops including quinoa, cowpea and mustard greens, \ndespite the lack of a current market.A crop like soybean that has rela-\ntively poor salt tolerance and high-water use is less suitable despite an \nexisting market.It is important to note that various crops may suit \ndifferent regions of the MRD where water scarcity or saline intrusion \nmay vary (Tran et al., 2018a ).4.Alternative management practices \nImplementing various management techniques can provide a cost- \neffective way to reduce the effects of salinity and maximise production \nof dry season alternative crops.Conserving soil moisture, monitoring \nirrigation, and establishing effective drainage are well proven manage -\nment options that can be used in conjunction with a suitable replace -\nment crop.4.1.Soil moisture conservation \nImplementing management techniques that retain soil moisture can \ndecrease the need for frequent irrigation and, where the irrigation water \nis saline, reduce a crop ’s consequent exposure to salinity.This can be \ndone via the use of soil surface mulches or soil moisture monitoring \ndevices.4.1.1.Mulching \nMulching with organic materials is an effective way to maintain soil moisture (Abd El-Mageed et al., 2016 ), reduce evaporation (Fu et al., \n2018 ), slow capillary rise and reduce the concentration of surface salt \n(Song et al., 2020 ).Straw mulch is a cheap, biodegradable soil covering \nmethod that has been used by many producers throughout Asia to limit \nthe effects of salinity.The benefits of mulch in relation to soil salinity, \nsoil moisture and yield are summarised in Table 3.Plastic coverings can decrease evaporation, increase yields, decrease \npesticide runoff (Steinmetz et al., 2016 ) and assist with the adverse ef-\nfects of transient salinity (Barrett-Lennard et al., 2021 ).Plastic mulches \nare beneficial for increasing soil temperatures in cool climates (Lin et al., \n2016 ;

What are the potential impacts of saline intrusion on agricultural yield and plant growth in the Mekong Delta, according to the referenced studies in the context?	Saline intrusion can have significant impacts on agricultural yield and plant growth in the Mekong Delta. Severe salinity intrusion events can affect the spatiotemporal distribution of rice planting areas in coastal provinces. Salinity can also impact the growth and yield parameters of NERICA Rice. Additionally, the use of brackish water for irrigation, combined with straw mulching, can influence soil salinity and crop yields under monsoonal climatic conditions. Furthermore, the adoption of salt-tolerant rice varieties has been observed as a farmer adaptation to rising sea levels. The impact of rice straw mulch on soil physical properties, sunflower root distribution, and yield in salt-affected clay-textured soil has also been studied.

What are some of the potential strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of salt stress on crop growth and yield, as mentioned in the context?	Several strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of salt stress on crop growth and yield are mentioned. One strategy is to use salt-tolerant crop varieties. For example, salt-tolerant varieties of cowpea can osmotically adjust by accumulating greater concentrations of Na+ in their roots during vegetative stages to minimise salinity damage. Quinoa, due to its halophytic nature, can withstand high levels of salinity and even increase biomass and yield production under saline conditions. Mustard greens with an overexpression of the SOS1 gene, associated with salt sensory mechanisms, have increased sequestration of Na+ in roots, making them more saline tolerant. Another strategy is to use crops that have efficient water use. Crops with high water use efficiency (WUE) or low water requirement can minimise the dependence on irrigation, which can lead to salt accumulation in the soil. Soybean and quinoa, for example, use less water throughout the growing season to achieve high levels of WUE. Lastly, the timing of planting can also be a strategy. Seedlings of alternative crops are planted when soil salinity levels are low, allowing them to withstand salinity exposure during vegetative and reproductive growth.	['Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n5season with canal water salt concentrations exceeding the 4 g L\x001 rice \nproducing threshold in lower elevations of the delta (Phung et al., 2020 ), \nsometimes reaching ~15 g L\x001 towards the end of the dry season (Eslami \net al., 2019 ).Rice will start to incur yield losses at 2 g L\x001 (Grattan et al., \n2002 ) and even salt tolerant varieties will suffer grain quality defects at \n3 to 4 g L\x001 (Qin et al., 2020 ).Consequently, plants that can either \ntolerate salinity during the reproductive stages of growth, or plants that \ncan be harvested early will be more suitable as alternative crops.Are there prospective salt tolerant crops for the MRD?Field trials of \npossible crops are just starting, but there are promising and notable \nalternative crops of whom demonstrate various cellular physiological \nmechanisms for tolerating salinity exposure.Salt-tolerant varieties of \ncowpea (Vigna unguiculata ) appear to osmotically adjust by accumu -\nlating greater concentrations of Na+in their roots during vegetative \nstages to minimise salinity damage (Le et al., 2021 ).The upregulated \nproduction of proteins involved in photorespiratory pathways also oc-\ncurs in cowpea plants exposed to salinity (De Abreu et al., 2014 ).Quinoa \n(Chenopodium quinoa) can withstand high levels of salinity due to its \nhalophytic nature and efficiency in excluding Na+from its leaves (Cai \nand Gao, 2020 ).In fact, quinoa has shown to have increased biomass \nand yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline \nconditions (Hariadi et al., 2011 ; Jacobsen et al., 2003 ).Characterisa -\ntion of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) involved in salt sensory \nmechanisms has occurred in quinoa (Maughan et al., 2009 ) with the \nplant demonstrating the ability to rapidly sequester salt into the vacuole \nto prevent the accumulation of cytoplasmic Na+(Cai and Gao, 2020 ).An \noverexpression of the SOS1 gene was also found in saline tolerant \nmustard greens (Brassica juncea) that was associated with an increased sequestration of Na+in roots (Singh et al., 2019 ).Proline is an osmo -\nprotectant that plays a critical role in counteracting osmotic stress and \nincreased concentrations of proline have been found in salt-stressed \nmaize (Zea mays) plants (Kaya et al., 2010 ).Whilst alternative crops have differing cellular physiological salt \ntolerance mechanisms, salinity also affects the agronomy and conse -\nquential yield in different ways.Seedlings are generally sensitive to salt \nexposure; however, seedlings of alternative crops are planted when soil \nsalinity levels are low.For this review, germination and seedling toler-\nance is irrelevant and will not be further investigated.Priority lays with \nan alternative crops ability to withstand salinity exposure during vege-\ntative and reproductive growth.Ultimately, the precedence is a crops \nability to produce marketable yield in a saline environment.Table 2 \nsummarises the yield response of alternative crop options at varying salt \nconcentrations including a relative ranking.Quinoa proves very salt tolerant and successfully produces grain \n(Hussain et al., 2020 ) at similar concentrations recorded in canals dur-\ning extreme salinisation events in the MRD (Eslami et al., 2019 ), whilst \ncowpea and mustard greens demonstrate high tolerance.The successful \ninoculation of cowpea played a significant role in the crops ability to \nwithstand increased salt concentrations (Manaf and Zayed, 2015 ).The \nreproductive phases of maize are affected by salinity with decreased \nkernel set and grain weight (Kaya et al., 2010 ) and consequentially, is \nranked lower than cowpea and mustard greens.Soybean has a low \ntolerance and ranks similarly to rice, although salt-tolerant soybean \nvarieties can increase photosynthetic rates to generate ~47% greater \ngrain yields than salt-sensitive varieties (He et al., 2016 ).', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n6protein content (Ghassemi-Golezani et al., 2009 ).3.2.Efficiency of water use \nA plant with efficient water use will assimilate more biomass or grain \nper unit of water.During the dry season in the MRD there are infrequent \nrainfall events (Dang et al., 2020 ) which need to be offset by the \nincreased use of irrigation water.Where this irrigation water contains salt, these salts can accumulate in the soils during the growing season.Alternative crops that have a high-water use efficiency (WUE) or low \nwater requirement may minimise the dependence on irrigation to \ncomplete their lifecycle.A plant ’s WUE is dependent on physiological \nprocesses, and anatomical and morphological adaptions that control \nwater movement (Liu et al., 2005 ).Decreased stomatal conductance will \nreduce transpiration rates, however there can also be decreased yields \nfrom concurrent decreased CO2 assimilation.A suitable replacement \ncrop will need to have elevated WUE without significant adverse effects \non yield.Fig.5 compares the WUE of a range of crops with potential for \ngrowth in the MRD.In general, higher WUE can be achieved with the \napplication of less irrigation water.Of the six crops listed in Fig.5, \nsoybean, and quinoa both use less water throughout the growing season \nto achieve the highest levels of WUE in this dataset (~8 kg ha\x001 mm\x001).By contrast, rice was a profligate user of water and had a far lower WUE.Cowpea was more water efficient in the post-rainy season and more \nresilient to water limited conditions that promoted high evapotranspi -\nration rates (Oumarou et al., 2015 ).Studies by Kang et al.(2000) show \nthat the WUE of maize is improved when plants experience drought \nstress at the seedling stage.These seedlings were better adapted to water \ndeficiency at stem-elongation and experienced no negative effects on \nyield.Similarly, the WUE of soybean was improved by incurring mild \nwater deficits before and after anthesis (Liu et al., 2005 ).The highest \nWUE for mustard greens was observed to be the treatment with rela-\ntively moderate water inputs (190 mm) compared to treatments with \nhigher irrigation (225 mm) (Kumar et al., 2020 ).Factors contributing to a plant ’s WUE are also intrinsically linked \nwith the physiological effects of salinity induced osmotic stress.Thus, \nWUE and a plant ’s ability to withstand saline conditions are often \nexamined together.The saline-tolerant quinoa variety Utusaya main -\ntained a higher stomatal conductance in saline conditions up to 12 g L\x001 \nNaCl with only a 25% reduction in CO2 assimilation compared to the \n67% reduction in the salt-sensitive variety ‘Titicaca ’ (Adolf et al., 2012 ).Stomatal conductance of salt-tolerant maize plants was unaffected by \nsalinity at NaCl concentrations up to ~6 g L\x001 mM and the variety \nBR5033 maintained its leaf water potential at this concentration despite \nthere being a reduction in root hydraulic conductivity (Azevedo Neto \net al., 2004 ).Cowpea was found to be tolerant of salinity induced water \nstress by decreasing transpiration rates without significant adverse ef-\nfects on yield (Düzdemir et al., 2009 ).Alternative crops with a low water use and high WUE are more suited \nfor growth in the MRD dry season to suit the minimal rainfall (Fig.5).The development and weakening of the monsoon system control the Table 2 \nThe effect of salt concentrations on the yield

"""What is the impact of saline irrigation water on the yield of mustard crops in semi-arid areas?"""	The impact of saline irrigation water on the yield of mustard crops in semi-arid areas is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

What are the potential effects of salinity stress on the growth and yield of crops like cowpea and mustard, according to the studies mentioned in the context?	Salinity stress can affect the growth and yield of crops like cowpea and mustard in various ways. For cowpea, salt-tolerant varieties seem to osmotically adjust by accumulating higher concentrations of sodium in their roots during vegetative stages to minimize salinity damage. The production of proteins involved in photorespiratory pathways also increases in cowpea plants exposed to salinity. The successful inoculation of cowpea plays a significant role in the crop's ability to withstand increased salt concentrations. On the other hand, mustard greens show an overexpression of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) when exposed to saline conditions. This overexpression is associated with an increased sequestration of sodium in the roots, contributing to the plant's tolerance to salinity. However, mustard greens can be affected by heat stress at early flowering stages. Despite these challenges, both cowpea and mustard greens demonstrate high tolerance to salinity.

Jacobsen et al., 2003 ).Characterisa -\ntion of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) involved in salt sensory \nmechanisms has occurred in quinoa (Maughan et al., 2009 ) with the \nplant demonstrating the ability to rapidly sequester salt into the vacuole \nto prevent the accumulation of cytoplasmic Na+(Cai and Gao, 2020 ).An \noverexpression of the SOS1 gene was also found in saline tolerant \nmustard greens (Brassica juncea) that was associated with an increased sequestration of Na+in roots (Singh et al., 2019 ).Proline is an osmo -\nprotectant that plays a critical role in counteracting osmotic stress and \nincreased concentrations of proline have been found in salt-stressed \nmaize (Zea mays) plants (Kaya et al., 2010 ).Whilst alternative crops have differing cellular physiological salt \ntolerance mechanisms, salinity also affects the agronomy and conse -\nquential yield in different ways.Seedlings are generally sensitive to salt \nexposure; however, seedlings of alternative crops are planted when soil \nsalinity levels are low.For this review, germination and seedling toler-\nance is irrelevant and will not be further investigated.Priority lays with \nan alternative crops ability to withstand salinity exposure during vege-\ntative and reproductive growth.Ultimately, the precedence is a crops \nability to produce marketable yield in a saline environment.Table 2 \nsummarises the yield response of alternative crop options at varying salt \nconcentrations including a relative ranking.Quinoa proves very salt tolerant and successfully produces grain \n(Hussain et al., 2020 ) at similar concentrations recorded in canals dur-\ning extreme salinisation events in the MRD (Eslami et al., 2019 ), whilst \ncowpea and mustard greens demonstrate high tolerance.The successful \ninoculation of cowpea played a significant role in the crops ability to \nwithstand increased salt concentrations (Manaf and Zayed, 2015 ).The \nreproductive phases of maize are affected by salinity with decreased \nkernel set and grain weight (Kaya et al., 2010 ) and consequentially, is \nranked lower than cowpea and mustard greens.Soybean has a low \ntolerance and ranks similarly to rice, although salt-tolerant soybean \nvarieties can increase photosynthetic rates to generate ~47% greater \ngrain yields than salt-sensitive varieties (He et al., 2016 ).', 'However, the higher water \nrequirement of maize and soybean may limit the crops suitability for \nlarger scale growth as an alternative to rice.Another possible alternative crop is quinoa; this tolerates a wide \nrange of temperatures (5–35 ◦C) (Oveisi, 2017 ) and is highly drought \nresistant with a low water requirement (Algosaibi et al., 2017 ; Telahigue \net al., 2017 ).Whilst its growth is not common in Vietnam, it has been \nsuccessfully grown in conditions similar to the MRD dry season (Choukr- \nAllah et al., 2016 ).However, quinoa ’s sensitivity to waterlogging \n(Gonz ´alez et al., 2009 ) would require careful management following its \ngrowth after a rice crop.Implementation of raised bed systems might \nsuccessfully alleviate waterlogging issues (Bakker et al., 2010 ).Mustard greens is affected by heat stress (35/15 ◦C) at early flow-\nering stages although biomass production is unaffected at moderate \ntemperatures (day/night) of 28/15 ◦C (Angadi et al., 2000 ).Cowpea has \nbeen successfully grown in the dry season of Niger where temperatures \nFig.6.An overlay of dry season canal salinity concentrations (average of Soc Trang and Dai Ngai) with average monthly rainfall and crop growing duration for \nquinoa, cowpea, mustard greens, maize, soybean and rice (Salinity data from Ratering Arntz (2018) .B.

What are the potential impacts of climate change-induced sea level rise on seawater intrusion and rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, according to the provided context?	The potential impacts of climate change-induced sea level rise on seawater intrusion and rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, include an average sea level rise of 3 mm per year and a forecasted sea level rise from 0.3 to 0.8 m by 2081 –2100. This could affect 75% of the land area and 70% of the population could be inundated. The rise in sea level, combined with land subsidence and tidal fluctuations, exacerbates saline intrusion. This is particularly problematic as the Mekong River Delta (MRD) has a marginal elevation above sea level, making it vulnerable to oceanic saline water intrusion. Salinity has been identified as the most prominent hazard to agricultural production, with the irrigation threshold for salinity detrimental to rice production being 4 g L. Saline intrusion has damaging effects on agricultural production, farmer livelihoods, and economic stability. In 2020, parts of the MRD declared emergencies with drought and salinity affecting over 100,000 ha of rice crop production as salt water intruded ~60 –70 km inland. It has been predicted that salt concentrations in 2050 will exceed 4 g L up to 60 km upriver from the ocean, meaning that inland areas like Can Tho will be subjected to the same severe salinisation currently observed in coastal areas.
