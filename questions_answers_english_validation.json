The first category includes methods \nin which the populatio n changes at a constant rate over time. This includes the Arithmetical \nIncrease Method, the Geometrical Increase Method, and the Simple Graphical Method. The \nArithmetical Increase Method assumes that the population changes at a constant rate over time \n(Sengupta, 2017). For a population that increases at a constant percentage each decade , the \nGeometrical Increase Method should be used (Sengupta, 2017). The average percent increase per \ndecade can be calculated using census data, and used to project further po pulation change \n(Gawatre  et al., 2016). In the Simple Graphical Method, a plot is made of the available census \ndata, and an appropriate curve drawn to connect the data. This curve can then be extended to \nproject future population growth (Gawatre  et al. , 2016).  \nThe second group covers comparative methods. This includes the Comparative Graphical \nMethod which compares the city whose future population is to be estimated to cities with \nconditions and characteristics similar to that city. Since these cities are similar, the assumption is \nthat they will develop in the same way (Sengupta, 2017). It also includes the Master Plan \nMethod. Most major cities create master plans that predict the development of the city for 25 to \n30 years into the future. These plans include fixed population densities in different areas in the \ncity. The Master Plan Method takes advantage of this fixed p opulation prediction to design water \nsupply systems to operate under the maximum future population (Sengupta, 2017).  \nThe third group includes methods that change inconsistently over time. This includes the \nIncremental Increase Method, the Decreasing Rate M ethod, the Logistic Curve Method, and the \nApportionment Method. The Incremental Increase Method uses aspects of both the Arithmetical \nIncrease Method and the Geometrical Increase Method. In this method, the future population is \ndetermined by a combination of the average increase per decade and the average percentage \nincrease per decade. This method uses the formula:  \nPn = P + n(la + lc)  \nwhere Pn represents the future population after \u2018n\u2019 number of decades, P is the population of the \nprevious decade, n is the number of decades, la is the average population increase per decade, \nand lc represents the average incremental increase per decade ( Sengupta, 2017).

To determine the final population forecast, the average decrease in growth is \nsubtracted from the latest perce ntage increase for each successive decade (Sengupta, 2017). The \nthird forecasting method is the Logistic Curve Method. In this method, the population is plotted \non a graph with respect to time. This logistical growth pattern can be seen in Figure 9 (Sengup ta, \n2017). This curved plot is characterized by its tendency to begin at a low rate of population rate, \ngrow to a high rate, and then return to a lower rate when it nears the saturation limit (Gawatre  et \nal., 2016).   \n \n \nA final method for projecting inconsistent p opulation growth is the Apportionment Method. Also \nknown as the ratio method, this method expresses the census population record as the percentage \nof the population of the whole country (Sengupta, 2017). The population of the city under \nconsideration and t he country\u2019s population for the last four to five decades are collected from the \ncensus department. The ratio of the town under consideration to the national population is \ncalculated for these decades. Then, a graph is plotted between these ratios and the time. The \nextension of this graph will give the ratio corresponding to the future years for which the \nforecasting of population is to be done. The ratio obtained is multiplied by the expected national \npopulation at the end of the designed period for determ ining the expected national population of \nthe town under reference (Sengupta, 2017).  \n A population forecast method from the third grouping is appropriate for Dania Beach \nbecause it has a population that changes inconsistently over time.

A crop like soybean that has rela-\ntively poor salt tolerance and high-water use is less suitable despite an \nexisting market. It is important to note that various crops may suit \ndifferent regions of the MRD where water scarcity or saline intrusion \nmay vary (Tran et al., 2018a ). \n4.Alternative management practices \nImplementing various management techniques can provide a cost- \neffective way to reduce the effects of salinity and maximise production \nof dry season alternative crops. Conserving soil moisture, monitoring \nirrigation, and establishing effective drainage are well proven manage -\nment options that can be used in conjunction with a suitable replace -\nment crop. \n4.1. Soil moisture conservation \nImplementing management techniques that retain soil moisture can \ndecrease the need for frequent irrigation and, where the irrigation water \nis saline, reduce a crop \u2019s consequent exposure to salinity. This can be \ndone via the use of soil surface mulches or soil moisture monitoring \ndevices. \n4.1.1. Mulching \nMulching with organic materials is an effective way to maintain soil moisture (Abd El-Mageed et al., 2016 ), reduce evaporation (Fu et al., \n2018 ), slow capillary rise and reduce the concentration of surface salt \n(Song et al., 2020 ). Straw mulch is a cheap, biodegradable soil covering \nmethod that has been used by many producers throughout Asia to limit \nthe effects of salinity. The benefits of mulch in relation to soil salinity, \nsoil moisture and yield are summarised in Table 3. \nPlastic coverings can decrease evaporation, increase yields, decrease \npesticide runoff (Steinmetz et al., 2016 ) and assist with the adverse ef-\nfects of transient salinity (Barrett-Lennard et al., 2021 ). Plastic mulches \nare beneficial for increasing soil temperatures in cool climates (Lin et al., \n2016 ; Dong et al., 2008 ), however this is not an issue in the MRD. The \nmajority of plastic mulches are polyethylene based and non- \nbiodegradable, thus the environmental implications of using plastic \nmulch must be carefully considered (Kasirajan and Ngouajio, 2012 ). \nResearch into biodegradable plastic mulches and microorganisms that \ndecompose plastic is still developing (Shah and Wu, 2020 ). \n4.1.2. Soil moisture monitoring \nFlooded rice production has dominated the MRD and thus there is a \nlack of knowledge regarding irrigation schedules for upland crops. \nMonitoring soil moisture throughout the dry season can help producers \ndevelop an irrigation schedule that will improve WUE and minimise the \namount of saline water applied. Tensiometers can be an effective tool to \nmonitor soil moisture and apply irrigation at the required time to \nmaintain adequate soil moisture, although they are not readily available \nto producers in the MRD. Successful monitoring of soil moisture in the \nMRD is dependent on affordable and easy to use devices.

Impacts of Flooding on Saltwater Intrusion  \n Flooding has been impacting groundwater quality over recent years because climate \nchange causes sea level rise and a higher intensity and frequency of severe storms. Coastal \nregions see high le vels of flooding specifically caused by storm surges and sea level rise, \nresulting in coastal surface water sources and aquifers facing issues in water quality. As coastal \nflooding occurs more frequently, an increased volume of saltwater is introduced into  coastal \naquifers and surface water sources (Mahmoodzadeh and Karamouz, 2017). Studies done on \npublic health issues after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita proved that storm surges \ncontaminated freshwater aquifers, and studies done in the northern Cook Islands  two years after \na category 5 cyclone showed atoll freshwater lenses (surface water sources) took between 11 to \n26 months to recover.

This decrease in groundwater is caused \nby both a lack of rain during droughts and the removal of water from aquifers faster than it can \nbe recharged. During droughts, aquifers are recharged much slower because there is no rainwater  \nseeping into the ground and entering into aquifers (USGS, n.d. -h). Because of this issue, aquifers \nby the coast can be recharged with saltwat er during droughts.  \nThe occurrence of saltwater intrusion in aquifers has increased significantly in the U.S. \ndue to droughts occurring across the country. Saltwater intrusion caused by droughts has been an \nissue in California since 1946. In 1946, the firs t documented report of saltwater intrusion in the \nstate was sent out from a farming center in the Salinas Valley (Walton, 2019).

This impact on the \nzone of dispersion could cause a disruption in the purity of a freshwater aquifer, especially in the \ndistant future (Chang et al. , 2011).  \nWhen sea levels rise, saltwater encroaches inland and moves closer to coastal aquifers. \nThis mov ement results from the change in freshwater and saltwater pressure gradients, which can \nbe caused by sea level rise, and is also impacted by decreased aquifer recharge and over pumping \nof aquifers (Prince Edward Island Department of Environment Labour and Justice, 2011). \nSaltwater intrusion due to sea level rise has been seen throughout coastal areas of the U.S., with \nFlorida being drastically impacted. Because Florida is a peninsula, the state is particularly \nimpacted by sea level rise. Time -lapse maps ill ustrate that sea level rise could cause southern \nFlorida to be submerged in water over time if the issue is not dealt with. It is also predicted that \nestuaries will become further extensions of the ocean instead of acting as protective barriers to \nthe main land (Machado, n.d.). Due to this rate of sea level rise, saltwater intrusion has already \nimpacted groundwater in Florida\u2019s coastal aquifers and caused groundwater to increase in \nsalinity. Unfortunately, these impacts are expected to increase in severity o ver time as sea levels \ncontinue to rise and over pumping of aquifers occurs in the state. As a result, Floridians could \nlose their access to freshwater wells as the issue progresses. In Miami -Dade County , three public \nwater supply well fields have already closed due to saltwater intrusion, with two of these public \nwater supply well fields shutting down permanently (Machado, n.d.). It was found that saltwater \nintrusion in Miami -Dade County  resulted from saltwater seeping from canals into groundwater \nand the encroachment of seawater inland along coastal aquifers, both of which have resulted \nfrom low water levels in aquifers (Machado, n.d.). Through further mapping and modeling, it has \nbeen shown that the movement of saltwater will cause the driving pressure fo r seawater to move \ninland through either coastal aquifers or through canals that exit to the ocean.

This framing gives greater weight to grey solutions to tackle human- and \nclimate change-driven water problems such as floods, coastal erosion and saltwater \nintrusion (van Staveren & van Tatenhove, 2016 ). In general, grey solutions give \npriority to hard infrastructures (e.g., dykes), which are believed by decision-makers \nto be highly effective due to their immediate response to acute risks. For most \ndeveloping countries, grey solutions are commonly adopted for achieving water \nsecurity and management (Muller et al., 2015 ). However, this approach has several \ndrawbacks. In coastal zones for example, it can alter coastal morphology, leading \nto changes in ecosystems (Charoenlerkthawin et al., 2022 ). In addition to the high \ncost of grey-led water management (Santoro et al., 2019 ), there remain concerns \nover whether\/how grey solutions can address water challenges in the long term \n(Browder et al., 2019 ; Collentine & Futter, 2018 ).\nMuch has been discussed on the role of green infrastructure in addressing today\u2019s \nclimatic- and human-driven disturbances. The concept of green infrastructure sheds \nlights on how green assets and ecological systems can help sustain society and build \nresilience, making it a \u2018society\u2019s natural life system\u2019 (Cilliers, 2019 ). Akin to nature- \nbased solutions (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2019 ) and embedded ecosystem services \n(Cook & Spray, 2012 ) which support adaptation in times of altered social\u2013ecological \nrelationships (Palomo et al., 2021 ), green infrastructure has gained wider acceptance \nin addressing multiple water challenges (Collentine & Futter, 2018 ). For example, it \nhelps mitigate rainfall and drought extremes. It is also a vital component of water, \nflood, and agriculture management programmes (Browder et al., 2019 ; Cook et al.,  \n2016 ). Green infrastructure is increasingly recognized as an important complement \nto grey solutions (Everard et al., 2021 ), with some arguing the need to realize the \ninterconnections between the natural and built environment and to enjoy the \naggregate benefits of the two approaches (Singhvi et al., 2022 ). These arguments \nposit that nature-based solutions have limits, and that judicious integration with \ntechnical management will be needed to ensure water security, and particularly with \nregards to agricultural sustainability (Staccione et al., 2021 ). While their benefits are \nrecognized, not much is known about how integrated solutions might support water \nretention for enhancing agricultural resilience in the water scarcity context of \nthe VMD.\nThere remains insufficient understanding of how grey\u2013green solutions are perceived \nby those involved in water resource management, especially concerning water retention \nfor agricultural resilience in the VMD. This gap raises concerns over the persistence of \ntechnical management in the context of multiple, compounding water challenges (e.g., \nwater disruptions, droughts and saltwater intrusion) in the long term (Tran et al., 2021b ). \nThe present study investigates this knowledge gap by examining: (1) how \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 \nsolutions are perceived by water managers through discussion of contemporary water \nmanagement practices, (2) how the integrated approaches inform household and institu -\ntional decisions to implement\/expand water retention across multiple scales (e.g., farm, \nhousehold, and landscape), and (3) how these \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 solutions might contribute to \nagricultural resilience.4\n T.

The paper provides an important insight into how \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 \nsolutions emerge as a vital water management approach in supporting agricultural \nproduction, and how they are mainstreamed into the water governance framework for \nagricultural development in the delta.\nConceptual framework\nAgricultural resilience\nThe concept \u2018resilience\u2019 has been widely used in various contexts, including climate \nchange, disaster risk reduction and natural resources governance (Beitnes et al.,  \n2022 ; Fallon et al., 2022 ). Resilience refers to the capacity to live with complexity, \nuncertainty and change, and to continuously develop in the context of ever- \nchanging environments (Folke et al., 2021 ). It also serves as a framework for \nunderstanding complex issues and an approach for informing policy change and \npractice (Rigg & Oven, 2015 ). Regarding water systems, resilience is commonly seen \nas an outcome of water governance (Fallon et al., 2022 ) and is associated with \noptions as well as with capacity to address water problems (Rodina, 2019 ).\nAgriculture is a socio-ecological system (Gardner et al., 2019 ). Understanding resi-\nlience in the agricultural context demonstrates how interactions between farmers, \ninstitutions and natural environments (e.g., water) are established, and how their \nrelations are sustained over time. Most developing countries, whose economies are \ndependent on agriculture, are in large deltas of the Global South. These nations are \ncommonly subject to adverse effects of climate change and human interventions \n(Nicholls et al., 2020 ). Attempts to build agricultural resilience have much relevance \nto water management and associated options to yield high crop productivity and \nlivelihoods (OECD\/FAO, 2021 ).\nWater management solutions revolve around ways to address water scarcity and surplus, \nboth of which place the agricultural sector at risk (Hui et al., 2022 ; Kontgis et al., 2019 ). In \nmost developing countries, water scarcity is a major challenge, causing significant hardship \nfor farming communities (Emile et al., 2022 ) and endangering food security (Christoforidou \net al., 2023 ). Water scarcity presents farming communities with critical challenges concern -\ning how they can secure agricultural profitability for enhanced household income \n(Giordano et al., 2019 ; Ranganathan et al., 2018 ). Reforming water policies to support \nagricultural resilience therefore has become a key component in most governments\u2019 \nagricultural development strategies (Nepal et al., 2021 ).

The electrical\nconductivity is measured at 25 \u00b0C from an unfiltered\n1:5 soil to deionized water suspension. Soil suspen-\nsions were prepared using 35 mL of distilled water\nand 7 g of soil into 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes\n(Cat. No. 06-443-20, Fisherbrand). Soil suspensions\nwere continuously shaken by using a mechanical\nshaker (132 rpm) at 25 \u00b0C for 60 min to dissolve sol-\nuble salts.

( 2012 ).\nAccording to He et al. ( 1992 ), electrical conductivity\n(EC 1:5) of a soil extract is the most widely used par-\nameter for describing soil salinity (Rayment and Hig-\nginson 1992 ). Electrical conductivity is estimated by\nthe concentration of ions in the soil that predomin-\nantly consists of the cations Na+, Ca2+,K+,a n dM g2+\nand the anions Cl-,S O 42-and HCO 3-(Rhoades et al.\n1989 ; Sumner and Naidu 1998 ). In soil, ions present\nmainly in soil solution and are adsorbed in soil col-\nloids. The standard laboratory method for determin-\ning the EC 1:5of a soil is by using a saturated paste\nextract (ECe) (Rayment and Higginson 1992 ).

Therefore, this study has\nchosen the EC 1:5index to determine the soil salinity.\nThe soil salinity map with five salty levels serves for\nland management and agricultural planning.

The relationship is unclear for the\nsand patterns with a high salinity value and low re-\nflectance in the NIR channel.

In addition, early warning systems for depletion and saltwater intrusion, protection zones, and reduced groundwater exploitation should be implemented, as well as increased use of other water sources such as artificial groundwater recharge, rainwater harvesting, and surface water.","source_nodes":[{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":3680,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"2","file_name":"1-s2.0-S221458182300112X-main.pdf"},"hash":"5a605674c74847b5b4ce6214b0b57317292cd7ae125d44db02cc8205d6f3c87a","id_":"eab3d017-749f-4153-b21c-a62e7347e444","metadata":{"page_label":"2","file_name":"1-s2.0-S221458182300112X-main.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":{"hash":"791f4c33376f865c9ca3df848c9a67b029f2a962e93e97c9e3aacfd7896c020e","metadata":{"page_label":"2","file_name":"1-s2.0-S221458182300112X-main.pdf"},"node_id":"e24e77a2-848a-40d5-a8ab-27dfe746f514","node_type":null},"node_id":"eab3d017-749f-4153-b21c-a62e7347e444","node_info":{"start":0,"end":3680},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":null,"ref_doc_id":"e41c2300-5621-440c-96b5-63a4ce19f31a","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"1dd8c0e7bdb9dc6d6da61a5e4f17aa0aad114f9b2ca90e4d4f87a1a78c82cdf9","metadata":{"page_label":"2","file_name":"1-s2.0-S221458182300112X-main.pdf"},"node_id":"e41c2300-5621-440c-96b5-63a4ce19f31a","node_type":null},"3":{"hash":"791f4c33376f865c9ca3df848c9a67b029f2a962e93e97c9e3aacfd7896c020e","metadata":{"page_label":"2","file_name":"1-s2.0-S221458182300112X-main.pdf"},"node_id":"e24e77a2-848a-40d5-a8ab-27dfe746f514","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"1dd8c0e7bdb9dc6d6da61a5e4f17aa0aad114f9b2ca90e4d4f87a1a78c82cdf9","metadata":{"page_label":"2","file_name":"1-s2.0-S221458182300112X-main.pdf"},"node_id":"e41c2300-5621-440c-96b5-63a4ce19f31a","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":0,"text":"Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 47 (2023) 101425\n21.Introduction \nPresently about 40 % of the world \u2019s population lives within 100 km of the coast and about 10 % live in coastal areas that are less \nthan 10 m above sea level (UN, 2017). In most of these coastal regions, water supply for domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities \nmainly depend on groundwater resources (Comte et al., 2016 ). With the rapid increasing world population, climate variations, and \nland-use change, freshwater availability has been facing a constant depletion and uncertainty in the future (Okello et al., 2015 ). Thus, \nthe importance of monitoring is becoming more and more pronounced, especially in groundwater conservation and management \n(Amore, 2012; Swathy, 2016 ). \nGroundwater depletion has been a major concern in aquifer systems in many countries over the world (Famiglietti, 2014 ). In \nseveral areas of China, overexploitation or reduction of groundwater recharge or combination caused groundwater depletion since the \n2000s (Changming et al., 2001; Feitelson, 2005; Zhou et al., 2013 ). For instance, in the Hai River basin, the most water shortage area in \nNorthern China, the cumulative groundwater overexploitation has reached to 40 billion m3 in the 2000s (Shen, 2015 ), causing many \nserious environmental issues such as groundwater quality deterioration, seawater intrusion, and land subsidence (Wang et al., 2017 ). \nIn the period from 2001 to 2008, the largest depletion intensity in the Central Valley of California was presented with a depleted rate of \naround 24 km3\/year (Konikow, 2015 ). Developing countries have also suffered from serious groundwater depletion caused by the \nincreasingly heavy pumping of groundwater in the long-term (Babel et al., 2006; Lacombe et al., 2017; Scanlon et al., 2012; Tularam \nand Krishna, 2009 ). Groundwater levels declined in a range of 45\u201350 m in Bangkok and 12\u201330 m in Ho Chi Minh City, respectively in \n25 years of groundwater extraction (Ha et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ). \nIn the coastal areas, both water supplies and valuable ecosystems have been under high pressure due to overexploitation and \nsaltwater intrusion and it will also increase in the future (Polemio and Walraevens, 2019; Post, 2005 ). The strong reliance on \ngroundwater to meet the local demand near the coast has resulted in several areas in a significant groundwater depletion, reversing the \ngradient of groundwater flow and leading to seawater intrusion (Hussain et al., 2015 ), and conflicts over the use, protection and \nmanagement of the coastal groundwater resources (Karim et al., 2008 ). \nGlobally, saltwater has intruded into many of the coastal aquifers across United States, Mexico, and Canada (Barlow and Reichard, \n2010 ) and coastal cities in Europe (Custodio, 2002; Custodio, 2010 ). Storm surges inundate low-lying coastal areas resulting in vertical \ninfiltration of saltwater into shallow aquifers (Paldor and Michael, 2021). According to the study by Vuong (2013) , the distribution of \nsaline groundwater in the aquifers of the whole Mekong Delta covers from 62 % to 84 % of the aquifer. These are predominantly old \nwaters trapped in the aquifer from past marine transgressions (Abu-Jaber and El-Naser, 2016; van Engelen et al., 2021; Van Pham \net al., 2019 ). Due to pumping from the aquifer, salinity might affect the freshwater zones and significantly affect the freshwater supply \ncapacity (Barlow, 2003; Greene et al., 2016 ). \nThe regional monitoring network provides important information required for managing and developing the policy of the \ngroundwater resources (Kang et al., 2020; van","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.8533821022},{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":3154,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"19","file_name":"hydrology-09-00061.pdf"},"hash":"93a4edaabdcc8ed5b8a70a5fc3b32a7644cf8378f0d182f4354e36cee546e69e","id_":"73018d27-0026-4eec-acdc-e5eb3616355f","metadata":{"page_label":"19","file_name":"hydrology-09-00061.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":{"hash":"4433c04bfa41427f80866f28a458a571850f1d6f2b3e8b4d0c403e09e1f3eb31","metadata":{"page_label":"19","file_name":"hydrology-09-00061.pdf"},"node_id":"6b2c5968-b551-44c1-bc89-f188df0da6db","node_type":null},"node_id":"73018d27-0026-4eec-acdc-e5eb3616355f","node_info":{"start":0,"end":3154},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":null,"ref_doc_id":"045344fc-526c-4dc5-bbb1-b51fc5e4d61c","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"9826f63ac04931f5d6f5afa04122fbe7fdc320945217433ceed2c309a98bae31","metadata":{"page_label":"19","file_name":"hydrology-09-00061.pdf"},"node_id":"045344fc-526c-4dc5-bbb1-b51fc5e4d61c","node_type":null},"3":{"hash":"4433c04bfa41427f80866f28a458a571850f1d6f2b3e8b4d0c403e09e1f3eb31","metadata":{"page_label":"19","file_name":"hydrology-09-00061.pdf"},"node_id":"6b2c5968-b551-44c1-bc89-f188df0da6db","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"9826f63ac04931f5d6f5afa04122fbe7fdc320945217433ceed2c309a98bae31","metadata":{"page_label":"19","file_name":"hydrology-09-00061.pdf"},"node_id":"045344fc-526c-4dc5-bbb1-b51fc5e4d61c","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":0,"text":"Hydrology 2022 ,9, 61 19 of 20\nDue to the large exploitation volume of the study area (567,000 m3\/day, 2019), recharge\nfrom outside the study area is not enough to compensate extraction, leading to declining\ngroundwater levels.\nIn particular, this article calculated and analyzed the water balance according to the\naquifers and identi\ufb01ed the sources of reserves (in\ufb02ow along the coastline, in\ufb02ow from the\nnorth) between offshore and mainland areas.\nThe reserves were calculated based on the model.

Consequently, even though the time period with \nfreshwater in the delta becomes shorter for every simula-tion as a result of the increased salinity, the microtide case still exhibits the longer freshwater period supporting the argument that river-dominated systems could benefit from a small amplitude increase. In addition, the transition of the buoyant plume\u2019s vertical structure from surface to bottom-advected type as the amplitude increases can be observed in the long reach model as well.\nMost importantly, the basic relationships presented in this \npaper remain unaffected. The salinity\u2013river discharge rela-tionship presents a single exponential correlation for the two maximum amplitude simulations (scenarios 4 and 5) and a double exponential one for the three bathymetry-controlled cases (scenarios 1, 2 and 3) in accordance to the short reach model results. Likewise, the salinity\u2013stream order relationship is present when symmetric spatially salinity distributions are developed. Since the salinity distributions are more symmetric than before in the long reach model, the microtide scenario exhibits the salinity\u2013stream order relationship in the entire simulation period in contrast to what is observed in the short reach model. However, the effects on this relationship from bathymetry are still detectable in the river-dominated systems.\nThis outcome supports further the argument in \u2018Salinity \nModel Setup\u2019 that in an idealized study the model testing should focus on the trends between variables and not their actual magnitudes.\nComparison with\u00a0a\u00a0Real Case Study\nTo strengthen and support the validity of the conclusions derived from the idealized model, a comparison is done with results from a similar work for a real case study.

In addition, they evaluated the response of the river delta to climate change by implementing a num-ber of scenarios with different estimations for future sea level, air\u2013sea fluxes and reduced discharges. Although they do not consider tidal variations in their model, their results for increased sea level and reduced discharges show much similarity with these of the present work where tidal ampli-tude increases and flow seasonality have been considered. One of their main considerations is that changes of river discharge are more influential to SWI than those of SLR. A look in the panels of Figs.\u00a0 2 and\u00a0 3 from the left to the \nright reveals much larger scale salinity changes from dry to wet seasons compared with these induced by TA changes. Moreover, they found that salt water intrusion in the main branches of the Po Delta is expected to extend by 80% for a scenario of relative sea level rise to 63\u00a0cm and a decrease of river discharge to 300\u2013350 m3\/s by 2100. A significant SWI extension is also noticed inside the idealized delta channels for the maximum amplitudes in the panels of Fig.\u00a0 4. In \nthis case, only a small number of channels are filled with freshwater even during the maximum flow times while the FWA covers almost the entire delta in the low amplitude scenarios at the same times. The SWI extension becomes maximum during flood tide. A comparison of the 2\u00a0g\/kg isohaline limits between the no tide and the macro-tide sce-nario shows an upstream displacement in the latter case by approximately 2\u00a0km in the longitudinal and 1.5\u00a0km in the lateral direction (Fig.\u00a0 4c). However, an important finding of \nthe present work is the positive effect that small increases of the TA can have against SWI because of the tide\u2019s contribu-tion to mixing. This is much reflected at the number of days with freshwater in the delta for each simulation as presented in Fig.\u00a0 9. Longer freshwater conditions were established \nin the delta in the microtide simulation compared to the no tide case.","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.8494186286},{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":6215,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"71","file_name":"s12237-022-01109-2.pdf"},"hash":"9d1f1a9589310f35b4ca48162e1ba30fb87e139cfca4a36604501354cefeef2e","id_":"8a59c645-be33-427a-a63b-867bd7fcab05","metadata":{"page_label":"71","file_name":"s12237-022-01109-2.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":null,"node_id":"8a59c645-be33-427a-a63b-867bd7fcab05","node_info":{"start":3437,"end":6215},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":{"hash":"d7bdbbe0fca62fac51d902f46cf262841680d05249f7fc321ef093b8bcdb2cfb","metadata":{"page_label":"71","file_name":"s12237-022-01109-2.pdf"},"node_id":"c7f80a77-18c7-46b2-83ff-35a257a64b97","node_type":null},"ref_doc_id":"8e0e6050-16cd-4dea-97d9-94c812dab18a","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"b834fbcd7b560552ddc0bbc45e0d37972f9ae49dafd3b45bd07ae143013b7ac0","metadata":{"page_label":"71","file_name":"s12237-022-01109-2.pdf"},"node_id":"8e0e6050-16cd-4dea-97d9-94c812dab18a","node_type":null},"2":{"hash":"d7bdbbe0fca62fac51d902f46cf262841680d05249f7fc321ef093b8bcdb2cfb","metadata":{"page_label":"71","file_name":"s12237-022-01109-2.pdf"},"node_id":"c7f80a77-18c7-46b2-83ff-35a257a64b97","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"b834fbcd7b560552ddc0bbc45e0d37972f9ae49dafd3b45bd07ae143013b7ac0","metadata":{"page_label":"71","file_name":"s12237-022-01109-2.pdf"},"node_id":"8e0e6050-16cd-4dea-97d9-94c812dab18a","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":3437,"text":"than that of the radial averages in \nthe SO ones because channels far from the delta apex and \ncloser to the lateral boundaries are included in every genera -\ntion increasing these averages.

However, very slight drought occurs more often, and the affected\narea in both seasons is also spatially larger than that in the very slight wet conditions. In\ngeneral, the SA rice cropping season showed wet conditions more frequently than the WS\nrice cropping season, whereas the WS rice cropping season experienced drought conditions\nmore frequently than the SA season. It should be noted that the higher positive SPI indicates\nmore rain in the SA rice cropping season, which could affect rice yield. Therefore, the\nPearson correlation was used to identify the relationship between SPI indices and saline\nwater intrusion with rice yield, as is shown in Figure 7.\nFor the SA rice cropping season, we found that the correlation between the average rice\nyield and the average SPI_SA in the VMD was 0.65 at a signi\ufb01cance level of alpha = 0.05 .\nMoreover, the salinity (Smin and Smax) at Vam Kenh Station (Co Chien River) and the an-\nnual winter-spring rice yield in the VMD was also found to be correlated with a correlation\nvalue of 0.82 for Smax and 0.8 for Smin, respectively; at a signi\ufb01cance level of alpha = 0.05 .\nIt should be noted that during the summer-autumn season, the yield decreases as the\npositive SPI increases. Salinity, on the other hand, is associated with SPI_WS during the WS\nseason. However, air temperature, hydraulic irrigation works, and rice farming practices\nhave the potential to be confounding variables that can affect rice yield.

Scenario Development\nFuture scenarios were developed based on the analysis of changes in upstream dis-\ncharge and water levels by referencing the latest of\ufb01cial report by MONRE and previous\nstudies [ 12,13,42,61]. According to monitoring data, during the period 2015\u20132020, the\naverage hourly river discharge in the dry season at Can Tho and My Thuan decreased\nby 417 m3\/s and 426 m3\/s, respectively. Furthermore, it was estimated that the average\nhourly river discharge in the dry season at Can Tho and My Thuan will change by \u2212128%\nand\u2212117% during the period 2020\u20132050, respectively (Table 1). A previous study indicated\nthat the average \ufb02ow from Can Tho and My Thuan was projected to change from \u221280%\nto\u2212100% with a sea level rise of 35 cm in the dry season between periods 2009\u20132011 and\n2036\u20132065 [ 13]. It can be estimated that the average sea level rise could be about 0.88 cm\nper year (i.e., 26 cm between 2020 and 2050) in the VMD. In addition, the sea level in the\nVMD was projected to increase from 22 cm to 26 cm in the 2050s compared to 2013 (i.e.,\n0.59 to 0.74 cm per year) under the climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 [ 42]. Other\nstudies suggest that the water level could increase by 0.55 cm per year [ 61,62]; therefore, it\nis reasonable to assume that the sea level in 2050 could increase by approximately 17 cm\nrelative to 2020 levels. However, according to MONRE [ 12], sea level rise was projected to\nrange from 23 to 28 cm by 2050 compared to the baseline period (1986\u20132005) under RCP2.6,\nRCP24.5, and RCP8.5. Thus, it is estimated that by mid-century, sea level rise would range\nbetween 0.46 and 0.56 cm per year (between 14 and 17 cm in the period 2020\u20132050). In\nthis study, reliable scenarios were developed to assess the impacts of sea level rise and\nupstream discharge reduction during the dry season, including sea level increases of 17, 22,\nand 26 cm combined with discharge reduction ranging from 80% to 128% (Table 1).\nTable 1.

During regression, the seawater can be pushed back out of the groundwater system, leading to a decrease in salinity and an increase in the availability of freshwater resources.","source_nodes":[{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":9173,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"17","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"hash":"99e15873246ea3301b353a7cd6ca1546a0e40bd37823cf3acc80c5b2256dce26","id_":"33dc2c0a-8ebd-4328-9ef0-b5549841728f","metadata":{"page_label":"17","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":null,"node_id":"33dc2c0a-8ebd-4328-9ef0-b5549841728f","node_info":{"start":7833,"end":9173},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":{"hash":"fdcbe63275fd034fa4dfd95cf1b2eac2a2e475796c6967bb906877d646ef96c1","metadata":{"page_label":"17","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"node_id":"0144e613-5ece-48c5-aa9c-374fa9e9dc3d","node_type":null},"ref_doc_id":"aeab9112-e0fc-47fd-8ea7-4be606ecbed2","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"944518b86bc8646a46811277c992a9171696b93a074dd9509ea748360f555b67","metadata":{"page_label":"17","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"node_id":"aeab9112-e0fc-47fd-8ea7-4be606ecbed2","node_type":null},"2":{"hash":"fdcbe63275fd034fa4dfd95cf1b2eac2a2e475796c6967bb906877d646ef96c1","metadata":{"page_label":"17","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"node_id":"0144e613-5ece-48c5-aa9c-374fa9e9dc3d","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"944518b86bc8646a46811277c992a9171696b93a074dd9509ea748360f555b67","metadata":{"page_label":"17","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"node_id":"aeab9112-e0fc-47fd-8ea7-4be606ecbed2","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":7833,"text":"V.B., Renaud, F.G., 2012.

A method of\nspatially monitoring soil salinity is proposed by using\nsatellite data-derived variables in order to support the\nmanagement of land resources and to determine the\nsuitable crops to cultivate. Results of the study show\nthat use of Landsat 8 OLI images allows one to estimate\nthe salinity value of the soil surface with an acceptable\naccuracy. It is found that the values of NIR band and\nVSSI indices are highly correlated with EC 1:5(dS\/m)\nwith coefficient of determinations 0.89 and 0.77, re-\nspectively, with corresponding lowest gradient values\n(biases) of 0.38 and 0.28, respectively. Error analysis\nshowed that soil salinity was relatively accurate for low\nsaline soils and underestimated for highly saline soils.\nThe underestimation may result from the poor repre-\nsentativeness of soil samples. That is to say, the NIR\nand VSSI models \u2019results most fit the observed salinity\nvalues in comparison with the other models imple-\nmented in our study. It is inevitable that climate change\nis affecting Tra Vinh Province by manifesting the sea\nlevel rise, salt water intrusion, and drought that lead toincreased soil salinity in the study areas, especially in\nthe lower-elevation terrains, such as coastal areas and\nestuaries. As a result, the agricultural cultivation in Tra\nVinh Province will be altered. Proper measures to miti-\ngate the impacts of increased soil salinity must be de-\nsigned in order to sustain the agriculture and economic\ndevelopment of Tra Vinh Province.\nIn addition, there is a need to further develop and im-\nprove the skills in the monitoring and forecasting of\nsalinization in the agricultural areas of Tra Vinh Prov-\nince and neighboring regions with potential to be vul-\nnerable to salinity intrusion. For example, adopting a\nnewly developed normalized difference latent heat index\n(NDLI) that could enhance the sensitivity on surface\nwater availability over land surface may lead to an im-\nproved monitoring of the salinization (Liou et al. 2019 ).\nFurthermore, although the proposed methodology of the\nstudy has been demonstrated to perform well in terms\nof extracting soil salinity information by using the Land-\nsat OLI data, an improved version of the proposed\nmethodology especially in spatial domains will be even\nmore beneficial to achieve a greater efficiency in contrib-\nuting to the orientation and planning of agricultural pro-\nduction areas of the salinity intrusion vulnerable regions.\nFig. 11 Soil salinity map with depth from 0 to 20 cm, using model VSSI index in Tra Vinh Province (equation 6 in Table 3)Nguyen et al.

Discussion\nThe results presented in this paper are discussed according to the following questions:\n1. How realistic are the used estimations on exploitation data?\n2. Can we verify the calculated groundwater balance for the Ca Mau peninsula?\nThe \ufb01rst question is important when considering model calibration and model un-\ncertainty. As described in Section 5.2, the groundwater model is calibrated assuming the\ncorrectness of the estimated pump rates. Thus, the pump rates (approved by the maximum\ndelivery quantities of the licensed abstraction wells) have an in\ufb02uence on the hydrogeo-\nlogical model parameters of permeability coef\ufb01cient and storage coef\ufb01cient. In order to\nvalidate the used pumping rates inside the groundwater model, we compared different\nliterature sources for the groundwater exploitation (Table 4).\nTo compare the used pumping rates (Table 2), a plausibility check of the pumping rates\ncan be performed using the daily water consumption per inhabitant. These results vary\nbetween 108 L\/person\/day in [ 13] and 297 L\/person\/day in the BGR Report 2017 [ 19] for\n2010. In the model presented here, a water consumption rate of 144 L\/person\/day was used.\nThe current average urban water use standard (including water loss) is 100 L\/person\/day;\nit was 120 L\/person\/day in 2015 and 130 L\/person\/day in 2020 and will be 130 L\/person\/day\nin 2025 [8].","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.86764273},{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":3823,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"7","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"hash":"451de217441917cd5de783a33c21f493c88f6e3c67f3cb67adc60a4af7b4780b","id_":"9fc59ee5-44c2-44a2-868a-bce6448b35a4","metadata":{"page_label":"7","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":{"hash":"b22a1f053db9ceb788ee0db6389aaeddca254745a9920445c859abff52ec4e0c","metadata":{"page_label":"7","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"node_id":"41f377c5-9746-45a6-a8f4-85a297320280","node_type":null},"node_id":"9fc59ee5-44c2-44a2-868a-bce6448b35a4","node_info":{"start":0,"end":3823},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":null,"ref_doc_id":"771bf752-507e-43df-a4ef-5c3049860e4f","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"43c71c9396a64a6cb7fe987d411d92b8123db7d4f546f1a6a3eef8b8128a39dd","metadata":{"page_label":"7","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"node_id":"771bf752-507e-43df-a4ef-5c3049860e4f","node_type":null},"3":{"hash":"b22a1f053db9ceb788ee0db6389aaeddca254745a9920445c859abff52ec4e0c","metadata":{"page_label":"7","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"node_id":"41f377c5-9746-45a6-a8f4-85a297320280","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"43c71c9396a64a6cb7fe987d411d92b8123db7d4f546f1a6a3eef8b8128a39dd","metadata":{"page_label":"7","file_name":"1-s2.0-S2214581822000234-main.pdf"},"node_id":"771bf752-507e-43df-a4ef-5c3049860e4f","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":0,"text":"Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n7then stacked (Turner, 2006 ). This approach is common in sedimentary environments and is widely used for groundwater mapping \n(Natali et al., 2012 ). Subsurface modelling was conducted using MATLAB 2020b (MathWorks Inc.). Top and bottom boundaries from \n14 layers recorded in 27 boreholes were used as 3-D scattered input data. \nWhile almost all boreholes reach aquifer qp1, except one, the number of boreholes reaching deeper layers are gradually decreasing \nwith only seven reaching aquifer n21 and only one the aquitard beneath. As this is a typical phenomenon in lithological data acquisition \n(Turner, 2006 ), all boreholes were vertically interpolated down to the Miocene aquifer n13 based on mean layer thickness from the \navailable data. No information from outside the study area was used because depth and thickness of stratigraphic units significantly \nvary throughout the delta (Nguyen et al., 2000 ) and might have therefore distorted the calculation. For the model, a 2-D grid was \ncreated with a 100m resolution in latitude and longitude direction using the meshgrid command, and for each layer a 3-D data \ninterpolation was done using triangulation-based natural neighbor method with griddata , which was then visualized using the mesh \ncommand. It should be noted that the quality of the provided borehole logs could not be further evaluated here and thus no extensive \nmodel validation was conducted. Based on the straightforward model approach, the model does not consider discontinues clay lenses \nwithin aquifers (Erban et al., 2013 ) and other potential small-scale characteristics, such as paleo channels as well as areas of \nnon-deposition and areas of erosion (Turner, 2006 ). \nGroundwater samples were plotted in this subsurface model to enable a sample to aquifer assignment. In order to account for a thin \naquitard between aquifer qp2\u20133 and qp1 and to account for possible aforementioned uncertainties in the interpolation, it was only \ndistinguished between Pleistocene and Pliocene samples. Samples outside of the convex hull were correlated with the nearest borehole \nand assigned to the respective aquifer. In addition, a 71.5 km long geological cross section was drawn through the model area. \nSamples, larger cities and monitoring wells within a 10km perpendicular distance to the profile were included. Location of monitoring \nwells and the course of the cross section are displayed in Fig. 2. Most monitoring wells accumulate around CMC. Extrapolation outside \nthe convex hull of the available borehole data was avoided intentionally to assure a more valid model within the verifiable boundaries. \nTherefore, the cross-section was not extrapolated to the sea. \n3.Results \n3.1. Water geochemistry \nMajor geochemical water parameters are listed in Table 2. EC values range between 571 \u00b5S\/cm and 5180 \u00b5S\/cm. 21 samples have \nEC between 2500 and 3850 \u00b5S\/cm while two samples in the northwest have EC around 5000 \u00b5S\/cm (Fig. 5c). A mean conversion factor \nfor EC to TDS of 0.81 was calculated. Note that this factor deviates from 0.67, which is commonly used by NAWAPI. As this conversion \nfactor is highly depended on ionic water composition the conversion factor presented here is more accurate for the study area and \nshould be considered for future water use guidelines. \nNa+is the dominant cation in the majority of samples in CMP. The Piper Diagram in Fig. 4 shows that Na-Cl, Na-HCO 3 and mixed \nwater types occur in Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers.

It is composed of \nthree islets. Its proximity to the Vietnamese East Sea makes it highly sensitive to saltwater \nintrusion and other climate-related impacts (e.g., drought and sea level rise).

Recently, \nBen Tre has experienced acute shortages of freshwater due to the accelerating process of \nsaltwater intrusion (Tran et al., 2021b ), posing challenges to both household water \nconsumption and agricultural production (Nguyen et al., 2019a ).

Furthermore, aquaculture is \n279also an important industry in the MDV, as the region's aquaculture production accounts for more \n280than 55% of the country's aquaculture production. Therefore, there is a need for policy and \n281management reforms to reduce the impact of drought and saline intrusion on aquaculture in this \n282area.\n283However, the impacts of the 2015-2016 drought on the economy were still greater than the 2020 \n284drought because the contribution of agriculture to the economy of the MDV and Vietnam is still \n285larger than that of aquaculture. According to GSO, the Gross Domestic Product of agriculture \n286accounted for about 72.8% of the agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture sector in 2020 while the \n287GDP of aquaculture only accounted for 22,4% of this sector [15].\n288In the social aspect, the number of affected households suffering from water shortage significantly. \n289During the 2015-2016 drought, the total number of households facing water shortages in the MDV \n290was 210,000, yet by the 2020 drought that number had dropped to 96,000. Although there is a lack \n291of data to extensively compare water shortages between provinces, the decrease in water shortage \n292households in Ben Tre and Kien Giang further reflects the overall reduction between the two \n293droughts. In Ben Tre, the number of water shortage households decreased from 41,000 to 20,000; \n294and from 44,000 to 11,300 in Kien Giang.\n295In conclusion, even with higher physical exposure in the 2020 drought, its impacts on the socio-\n296economy were still less than those experienced during the 2015-2016 drought. Previous studies of \n297drought and saltwater intrusion in this area have often addressed physical exposure and proposed \n298strategies to prepare for, adapt to, and manage these issues [52\u201355]. In fact, following the great \n299damage caused by the 2015-2016 drought, Vietnamese authorities of all levels from central to local \n300government have introduced and adjusted policies and management directions to reduce the risks \n301of drought and saltwater intrusion. Adaptation methods to drought and saltwater intrusion based \n302on scientific research and local experience like early warning, raising awareness, innovating \n303irrigation systems, or shifting sowing days have been applied and they have helped to achieve \n304certain positive results. The next section will delve into the policy and governance changes after \n305the 2015-2016 drought. It will bring out the lessons learned in the preparedness, adaptation, and \n306management of drought and saline intrusion by authorities and local people, and propose future \n307direction of policy and management reform to improve existing problems.\n3083.4 Management and policy change in drought and saline intrusion preparedness, mitigation, \n309and adaptation and lesson learned for future risk reduction strategies\n310Vietnam has made great strides in its efforts to reduce drought and saline intrusion. The National \n311Strategy for Natural Disaster Prevention, Control, and Mitigation up to 2020 mentions drought and \n312saltwater intrusion risk; however, only one project linked to drought risk reduction and none \n313related to saltwater intrusion risk reduction was implemented. Looking ahead, the National \n314Strategy for Natural Disaster Prevention, Control, and Mitigation to 2030 with a vision to 2050 \n315indicates two projects related to drought and none related to saltwater intrusion risk reduction. \n316Table 4 presents that, after the 2015-2016 drought, policies concerning drought and saline intrusion \n317management were issued more often because the government has become aware of the \nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

To provide the  City of Dania Beach Wa ter Utility water from \nBroward County WWS , pipe connections would  have to be made . To achieve this  connection , a \npipe approximately one mile long would need to be constructed. Overall, construction of this \npipe results in a  cost increase of 4.5% to the City of Dania Beach Water Utility\u2019s monthly bill.  \nThis increase of 4.5% would be feasible for the residents of Dania Beach , while still considering \nthe average income and poverty rate of the city  discussed in Section 3.1.  Pipe connections \nbetween Dania Beach  and Miami -Dade County require more labor and construction because the \ndistance between Dania Beach and Miami is 20 miles. Construction of a 20-mile pipe results in a \ncost increase of 90. 9% to the City of Dania Beach Water Utility\u2019s monthly bill. This incre ase \nwould not be feasible for the residents of Dania Beach due to the city\u2019s poverty  rate and average \nincome . Therefore, it is not suitable  for Dania Beach to purchase water from Miami -Dade \nCounty . Pipe connections between Dania Beach and Fort Lauderdale would require less labor \nand construction than what is required between Dania Beach and Miami -Dade County, as Dania \nBeach and Fort Lauderdale are 5.1 miles apart . The construction of this pipe would result in a \n23.2%  water bill  increase . This in crease  of 23. 2% would be feasible for the residents of Dania \nBeach  who are above the poverty line. However, considering the city\u2019s poverty rate and average \nincome discussed in Section 3.1 , this cost may be difficult to some residents of the city . \nTherefore, it is not the best option for Dania Beach to purchase raw water from Fort Lauderdale. \nTo minimize increases in customer\u2019s water bills, it is suggested for Dania Beach to purchase raw \nwater from Broward County \u2019s regional wellfield  before considering Fort Lauderdale \u2019s raw water  \nbecause no money needs to be spent on pipe connections between Dania Beach \u2019s water utility \nand Broward County \u2019s regional wellfield .  \n Overall, the option of Dania Beach purchasing water from a nea rby wellfield  ranks 4 7\/50. \nThis ranking only considered purchasing water from Broward County \u2019s regional wellfield , as \nthis is the most cost-effective  option.  As shown in Table 4, the criteria Cost received a ranking of \n9 (green) because the  overall cost of pur chasing water is relatively low and would be \ncompensated for by charging the residents of Dania Beach for their water use.

Combined use of these two treatment \nsystems reduces chemical use and the costs that come with post treatment processes (Day, 2017) .  \n \n3.4. Long Term Management Plan for Dania Beach\u2019s Water Supply  \nBecause Dania Beach\u2019s wells are facing water quality issues caused by saltwater \nintrusion, a long -term management plan for water supply is needed for the portion of the city \nserved by the City of Dania Beach Water Utility. As dis cussed in Section 3.2.3, the 2020 water \ndemand for the area of Dania Beach supplied by the City of Dania Beach Water is estimated at  \n2.33 MGD  based on population and a 120 GPD per capita usage . There is additional demand in \nthe area supplie d by Broward County  WWS . These two supply systems are not connected . \nBroward County  WWS  has no intentions of selling its entire water system to Dania Beach . The \nseparation of these systems is planned to continue well into the future, as the two systems are run \nby separate entities (Personal communications, Fred Bloetscher, February 25, 2022).  Therefore, \nonly the City of Dania Beach Water Utility system is taken into consideration in t he majority of \nthis section.  \nThe City of Dania Beach Water Utility is supplied with water from a lime softening \ntreatment plant and a nanofiltration treatment plant. The capacity of the lime softening water \ntreatment plant is 3 MGD, and the capacity of the nanofiltration treatment plant is 5 MGD, \nproducing a combined capacit y of 8 MGD. In 2050, the total water demand will be 3. 15 MGD \nfor the portion of Dania Beach that receives service from the water utility. Currently, both water \ntreatment plants work together and are not capable of treating water with high salinity levels. The \nlime softening plant is not  able to handle saltwater intrusion because it does not have the proper \nequipment included in the plant. The nanofiltration plant is not able  to handle saltwater intrusion \neither. While the nanofiltration plant contains rever se osmosis membranes, it cannot effectively \ntreat saltwater because it does not operate at a high enough pressure. The pressure in the \nnanofiltration plant does not exceed 225 psi, and a minimum pressure of 800 psi would be \nneeded to treat saltwater in Dan ia Beach (Personal communications, Fred Bloetscher, February 8","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.8154374054},{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":1726,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"38","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"},"hash":"fe653b51dcdebc6e192d9b507a66fee7c6abc9bfcb97c2ed3f388ab974646ea8","id_":"2f69559e-0c3f-455c-a86a-2e8a760b4e5f","metadata":{"page_label":"38","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":null,"node_id":"2f69559e-0c3f-455c-a86a-2e8a760b4e5f","node_info":{"start":0,"end":1726},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":null,"ref_doc_id":"61d06d4a-da4a-48e0-84e2-db697386d48a","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"89b548c37821f732a4e04b13ff231996f5f95bb7cf3d35a519aff97b44bc65b0","metadata":{"page_label":"38","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"},"node_id":"61d06d4a-da4a-48e0-84e2-db697386d48a","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"89b548c37821f732a4e04b13ff231996f5f95bb7cf3d35a519aff97b44bc65b0","metadata":{"page_label":"38","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"},"node_id":"61d06d4a-da4a-48e0-84e2-db697386d48a","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":0,"text":"28 saltwater intrusion were obtained from one journal article and one editorial found throu gh an \ninternet search for \u201cDania Beach water treatment plant\u201d.  \n\u2022 \u201cDania Beach Goes Gold with Nanofiltration Plant\u201d \n(https:\/\/www.bluetoad.com\/display_article.php?id=1491810&vi ew=173183 ) This journal \narticle describes the construction, design, and LEED certification process of Dania \nBeach\u2019s nanofiltration plant.   \n\u2022 \u201cThis Nanofiltration Water Treatment Plant Boasts a 96% Recovery Rate\u201d \n(https:\/\/www.tpomag.com\/editorial\/2017\/07\/this_nanofiltration_water_treatment_plant_b\noasts_a_96_recovery_rate  ).

Applying the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the maximum and minimum values\nof annual average salinity, we spatially examine the effects of drought and saline water intrusion\non rice yields over a 40-year period (1980\u20132019). Our results highlight that 42% of the natural land\narea of the VMD has experienced increased drought occurrence during the winter-spring (WS) rice\ncropping season, while certain inland regions have additionally experienced increased drought\noccurrence during the summer-autumn (SA) rice cropping season. The Tri Ton Station, which has a\nsigni\ufb01cant Sen\u2019s slope of \u22120.025 and a p-value of 0.05, represents an upstream semi-mountainous part\nof the delta, indicative of a rising severity of reoccurring drought. It should be noted that the yield\ndecreases during the summer-autumn season as the positive SPI_SA increases. Salinity, on the other\nhand, is associated with SPI_WS during the winter-spring season. Our results highlight the need for\nimproved evidence-based planning and investments in priority adaptation for both sustainable water\ninfrastructure and to improve system resilience.\nKeywords: drought; saline water intrusion; Standardized Precipitation Index; rice yield; Mekong\nDelta; adaptation\n1.

Introduction\n44Drought is a well-known hydrological hazard. It is described as a period that lasts for many months \n45or years when an area experiences water shortages as part of the natural climate cycle [1]. In recent \n46years, because of the impacts of climate change, drought is becoming increasingly severe and \n47frequent worldwide [2]. Drought often goes together in coastal areas with saline intrusion [3,4]. \n48Saline intrusion is the movement of brackish or saline water into freshwater aquifers, resulting in \n49concentrations of salt and other seawater-derived ions rising higher than natural background levels \n50[5].\n51Coastal estuarine deltas are highly exposed to drought and saline intrusion. An estuarine delta is \n52formed when a river empties into another body of water, such as another river, lake, or ocean, or \n53rarely into a land basin [6,7]. Coastal zones are the transition zones between land and sea, including \n54coastal water and land areas [8]. Coastal estuarine deltas inherit the characteristics of both estuarine \n55deltas and coastal zones. They are generally low gradient, have low elevation topography, fertile \n56soils, and are close to rivers and seas. These characteristics make them ideal places for humans \n57and ecosystems [9,10]. However, these characteristics also increase exposure to various \n58vulnerability stressors and enhance risks [11]. Therefore, if drought and saline intrusion occur, \n59they will have a significant impact on all aspects of socio-economy and nature in coastal estuarine \n60deltas.\n61The Mekong Delta of Vietnam (MDV) is the largest delta in Southeast Asia, formed when the \n62Mekong River enters the East Sea of Vietnam [12\u201314]. The MDV is considered the rice granary \n63of Vietnam. According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), approximately 55% of \n64rice production and 90% of rice export of the nation are from the MDV, which pushes the economic \n65growth rate of this area to 7.8%, higher than the national average of 1% [15]. However, drought \n66and saline intrusion cause adverse impacts on socioeconomic development in every dry season \n67[16].\n68The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is a reliable tool to identify and \n69analyse drought exposure. It was developed by Vicente-Serrano et al. [17] and is designed to \n70consider both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in determining drought [18]. The SPEI \n71can be calculated for time steps from 1 month up to 48 months to identify wet and dry events. It is \n72being widely used in many countries and regions in the wo Southern Europe, Central Asia, China, \n73India, Spain, and the USA [19\u201324]. In Vietnam, it has been used primarily on drought assessment \n74[25\u201327].\nThis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Ideally, alternative dry season replace -\nment crops would be capable of being grown using the same rice- \nproducing equipment already available to farmers, without major \nmodification, although there will be limits to this. Unlike rice which \nrequires anaerobic soil conditions (Rauf et al., 2019 ), alternative crops \nwill generally require aerobic soil conditions for growth. Bed formation may become a critical part of field preparation prior to sowing for some \nalternative crops, particularly those with limited waterlogging tolerance \nlike quinoa (Gonz \u00b4alez et al., 2009 ). In 2010, the use of mechanisation to \nprepare land in the MRD was 70% of rice farm production area and over \n60% of rice was harvested using a combine harvester (Takeshima et al., \n2018 ). The seeds of identified alternative crops can be sown via direct \nplacement into the soil, either by hand or implement. These crops do not \nrequire transplanting like rice, and this reduces one labour component \nfrom the system. For some crops harvesting can be performed using rice \nharvesters; approximately one harvester exists per 50 ha of cropping \nproduction land in the MRD (Nguyen et al., 2020a ). Minor modifications \nto the header front, sieves, fan and rotor speeds to suit each crop can be \nmade to optimise harvest yields. Processing equipment is common on \nfarm including mechanical corn shelling machines (Dang et al., 2004 ) or \ndryers for moist grain (Nguyen et al., 2020a ). \nSome identified alternative crops including maize (Rashid et al., \n2013 ) and soybean (Ho Manh et al., 2016 ) are already grown in the MRD \nwith farmers aware of the production cycle and labour required. How-\never, the production of other alternative crops in the MRD dry season \nwill be influenced by the successful adaption and use of available \nmechanisation (Nguyen et al., 2020a ). \n3.6. Profitability and availability of a market chain \nThe production of an alternative dry season crop must be financially \nviable for farmers. The shift from double- to triple-rice production \ninitially improved the profitability of rice monoculture systems in the \nMRD, but required significant increases in inputs, particularly fertilisers \nand pesticides. Over time, as the cost of these inputs has increased, the \nprofit margin of triple-rice production has gradually decreased \n(WorldBank, 2016 ). The cost of pesticides and fertilisers was recently \nestimated at 50\u201360% of total production costs in the MRD, while the \nprofitability of triple-rice systems relative to double-rice systems had \ndeclined significantly, with total yields in some cases less than in double- \nrice systems (Tran et al., 2018b ). \nViability includes having an available market to trade produce. \nFarmers in the MRD are familiar with identifying new market chains \nwhen adapting to alternative farming practices, as evidenced by the \nimplementation of rice and shrimp farming (Dang, 2020 ). In addition, \nMRD farmers have already established market chains for some alterna -\ntive crops including maize and soybean. In a 2004 survey, farmers re-\nported that large quantities of maize could be sold via traders and \ncollectors from the farm gate which saved on transportation labour and \ncosts (Dang et al., 2004 ). Further opportunities for selling produce at \nvillage markets provides additional income to famers. An absence of \nmarket chain exists for crops like quinoa in the MRD, however the global \nquinoa market is rapidly expanding (Alandia et al., 2020 ) with over 120 \ncountries now growing it (Bazile et al., 2016 ).

However, especially in redox-sensitive \nmarine and coastal settings, the difference between total alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity may not be neglected due to the \nimpact of other buffering bases such as B(OH) 4-, NH3, Si(OH) 3 O-, or F- (Lukawska-Matuszewska, 2016 ). \nThe conversion factor for EC to TDS is highly depended on ionic water composition and may differ from the instrument value, \nwhich is typically calibrated by KCl solution (Vengosh, 2013 ). Therefore, TDS was calculated for each sample using the software \nGeochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC) with the whole elemental composition as input data. Furthermore, the \ndirect relationship between all parameters was calculated using pairwise Spearman correlation. \nThe calcium carbonate system in coastal groundwater settings is complex, and many processes actually lead to carbonate disso -\nlution with subsequent increase in HCO 3- and Ca2+(Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ). In saline aquifers, mixing of calcium carbonate \nsaturated fresh groundwater with seawater, which is typically oversaturated, produces brackish water which is undersaturated with \nregard to calcium carbonate due to the reduction in ionic strength, leading to calcite dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ). \nThe saturation indices for calcite (SIcalcite) were calculated using Geochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC). \nFurthermore, SI of additional evaporites including aragonite, dolomite, gypsum, sylvite and halite were calculated. \nThe proportion of major cations Na++K+, Ca2+and Mg2+and anions HCO 3-, Cl- and SO42- were calculated and displayed in a Piper \nDiagram (Piper, 1944 ).

However, divisions and percentages used for clas-\nsification should be selected as to best fit the characteristics of the investigated water (Freeze and Cherry, 1979 ). Therefore, to achieve \na more detailed water type specification and to get more insights on mixed water types, the typical description was customized in order \nto more accurately display different states of salinization with an emphasis on cation-exchange processes. Proportions of major ions \nwere calculated and if only one cation or anion was above 33.3%, it is written alone, like Na-Cl water type, while if two ions were above \n33.3%, the ion with the higher proportion was written first, followed by the second ion in brackets, for example Na-Cl-(HCO 3). A mixed \nwater type is thus only defined if all three anions or cations have an equal share of around 33.3%, e.g. Na-Ca-Mg-Cl is written as Mix-Cl. \n2.2.3.

It is necessary  to study each area\u2019s specific characteristics \nand needs for designing the specific package of projects for each area.

Recent technolog ies and \ninnovation must be utilized in the improvement plan. Subsequently , the RID must \nallocate water base d on the types of usage , for instance , consumption, agriculture , \nenvironmental  protection,  and industry  to ensure  that all stakeholders can equitably \naccess water according to the water reserve .  \n3) Prevent and mitigate water hazards   \nThere are three main concepts  of disaster management : (i) pre-disaster \u2013 preventive  \nmeasures ; (ii) during the disaster \u2013 m anagement  measures ; and (iii) post -disaster \u2013 \nrehabilitation measure s.

GUIDANCE FOR TECHNOLOGIES TO ADDRESS  \nISSUES IN THE IRRIGATION SECTOR  \n \n This section describes  technologies that can be applied to  the LMB to address  issues in the \nirrigation sector. Th ese technologies can be adapted to both the  system level and the field \nlevel , which  are classified into three technical level s. These technologies can be applied to the \ncountries according to  their  irrigation development.  \n \n6.1 The system   \n 6.1.1 Canal  lining (low level)   \n Concept  \n Canal lining is the covering of the bed surface and canal walls  with an impermeable layer for \nreducing water seepage loss, enhancing its durability and improving its service life  (Figure 71) .  \n Benefits  \n The b enefits  of canal lining are : (i) water conservation ; (ii) no seepage of water into adjacent \nland or roads ; (iii) reduced canal dimensions ; and (iv) r educed maintenance (FAO, 1992).  In \nparticular,  lined irrigation c anals reduce  more water loss than unlined ones . Since  many canals \nare earth canals in the LMB, a great deal of water leaks from them. C anals that carry from 30 \nto 150 l \/s can lose 10 % to 15% of this flow by seepage and water consumption by weeds. \nLining a canal will not  completely eliminate these losses, but approximately  60% to 80% of \nthe water lost in unlined irrigation canals can be saved by a hard -surface lining  (FAO, 1992).   \n Surface  lining , such as  concrete, brick or plastic, of a canal prevents the growth of plants and \ndiscourages hole -making by rats or termites, and the maintenance of a lined canal can be \neasier and quicker than that of an unlined canal. Moreover, the higher velocity that can safely be allowed in the lined canal prevents the small particles of soil in the canal from accumulating \nand causing siltation  (FAO,1992).   \n \n     \n a)       b)   \nFigure 71 . a) No n-lined canal and b) Lined  canal following repairs","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.874716133},{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":907,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"104","file_name":"IrrigationGuidance.pdf"},"hash":"efc2d635a9796c6d9a201c14ffd4df590c4308da7ca4631e6a757c3810084276","id_":"0787ca8e-c7a5-4687-9277-0dbb84c524bc","metadata":{"page_label":"104","file_name":"IrrigationGuidance.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":null,"node_id":"0787ca8e-c7a5-4687-9277-0dbb84c524bc","node_info":{"start":0,"end":907},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":null,"ref_doc_id":"9c8d2ebd-3ddf-42e6-9fd7-4d0dd4f62971","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"09830ee36078543de75542fbddb036069a974ba83eda9dca4aa0bdf9800a0cb0","metadata":{"page_label":"104","file_name":"IrrigationGuidance.pdf"},"node_id":"9c8d2ebd-3ddf-42e6-9fd7-4d0dd4f62971","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"09830ee36078543de75542fbddb036069a974ba83eda9dca4aa0bdf9800a0cb0","metadata":{"page_label":"104","file_name":"IrrigationGuidance.pdf"},"node_id":"9c8d2ebd-3ddf-42e6-9fd7-4d0dd4f62971","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":0,"text":"91 \n  \nType of canal lining   \n \nThe commonly  used  lining  types  are concrete , stone  masonry , soil cement , and concrete  \nflume.    \n \uf0d8 The c oncrete lining  \n Concrete lining  is the most common type of  lining for  main and secondary canals in the LMB  \n(Figure  73).

Following the 2015-2016 drought, irrigation \n338improvement projects were established, such as the construction of new pumping stations and \n339aqueducts.

However, the drought and saline intrusion information and the recommendations from \n356local authorities were not conveyed to the whole population or were not completely trusted by the \n357local people. Due to this, many people still randomly chose to sow late, resulting in damage in \n358many agricultural areas due to drought and saline intrusion later.\n359In the social context, all provinces within the study area had taken necessary precautions to adapt \n360to drought, water scarcity, and saltwater intrusion. In addition to advising people to store water \n361prior to the dry season, local governments had employed various measures to combat drought and \n362saltwater intrusion, such as providing free water to 20,600 households, schools, and hospitals in \n363regions with insufficient freshwater resources; supporting the installation of water storage tanks \n364for 37,300 households; distributing drinking water bottles to 11,800 households; broadening and \n365extending pipeline systems, as well as drilling supplementary underground wells to around 22,300 \n366households; and installing water purification equipment in about 4,000 households.\n367In summary, the key point that led to the positive changes in drought and saline intrusion \n368management in 2020 compared to 2016 was good preparedness and experience from the previous \n369drought. This created the initiative for improved management and resulted in the establishment of \n370appropriate policies on water resource management, irrigation system management, agricultural \n371production strategy, communication strategy, and social security strategy. Nevertheless, there were \n372still some farmers who sowed seeds voluntarily, without following the recommendations of local \n373authorities, and the impacted area of the aquaculture industry was still expanding due to inadequate \n374management. Consequently, there is still a need to explore the impacts of drought and saline \n375intrusion on various socioeconomic factors, as well as measures to effectively manage them.\n3764 Conclusion\n377This study attempts to prove that the impacts of drought and saline intrusion on the socio-economy \n378of the coastal provinces in MDV in the 2020 drought are less than those of the 2015-2016 drought, \n379even though the physical exposure of the latter drought is higher than the previous one. By using \n380SPEI and a saline boundary of 4g\/l, the study highlights that drought and saline intrusion worsened \n381over time, with the 2020 drought being the worst. By comparing the impacts of the two droughts \n382on agriculture, aquaculture, and water supply, the study determined that the 2020 drought had \n383lesser impacts than those of the 2015-2016 drought in general. It concludes that good policy \n384decisions and governance in four aspects of disaster management, including mitigation, \n385preparedness, response, and recovery, gave positive results in reducing drought and saline \n386intrusion impacts in 2020.\n387The progress in drought and saltwater intrusion management in the coastal area of the MDV is a \n388good example of how these measures can be applied in other areas with similar geographical and \n389climatic features. However, there are still various aspects that need to be further improved and \n390require more detailed research. Firstly, the potential for aquaculture production in the presence of \n391prolonged drought and saline intrusion needs to be explored further, as this is the second most \n392popular economic sector in the Mekong Delta after rice production. Secondly, it is important to \n393reassess and improve the outreach efforts to raise awareness and strengthen the bond between \n394people and their local government.

The temperatures in the area\nare relatively high (26 \u201327.6 \u00b0C), while their differ-\nence is not much during the season.

Average eva potranspiration variesfrom 48 mm in July to 111 mm in March. The high-\nest evapotranspiration occurs in the dry season from\nDecember to April, during which timeframe rainfall\nis negligible. The Tra Vinh Province is directly af-\nfected by the semi-tide regime of the East Sea\nthrough the Co Chien River and Hau River (Provin-\ncial Report in 2011 \u20132015 ).

Finally, based on the results a priority list of \nmonitoring wells was recommended for monitoring network implementation and management. \n2.Materials and methods \n2.1. Study area and hydrogeology \nThe study was conducted in Tra Vinh Province located in the coastal area of Mekong Delta (Fig. 1). The province has 65 km of \ncoastline between two large rivers, the Hau River and the Co Chien River. These two rivers supply fresh water, deposit alluvial sed-\niments and are important waterways linking the ports in Tra Vinh. The annual average precipitation in the northeast is around 1500 \nmm\/a while it rises to 1700 mm per year in the southwest (Mai et al., 2014 ). The wet season typically last from April to November, with \nthe whole province receiving approximate 90 % of the annual rainfall. Severe droughts have impacted all provinces of the Mekong \nDelta in 1985 \u20132018 (Quang et al., 2021 ). Temperatures are relatively constant through the year with an average of 27 \u25e6C. The Tra Vinh \nprovince covers an area of 2341 km2 and is very flat with elevations just above mean sea level in most areas, with slight elevations of a \nfew meters above mean sea level occurring only in sand dunes and roads (Fig. 1). \nAs the distinguishing characteristic of the Mekong Delta basin fill, the stratigraphy in the Tra Vinh area was formed during the \nprocess of transgression and regression events (Nguyen et al., 2004; Van Pham et al., 2019 ). The process lasts from the late Neogene \n(Miocene, Pliocene) up to the Holocene period, in which the sediment of the stratigraphy has resulted in seven heterogeneous for-\nmations. In each formation, there are two parts: the upper part with low permeability consists of silt, clay, or silty clay (aquitards); and \nthe lower part with high permeability (aquifers), which includes fine to coarse sand (Minderhoud et al., 2017; Van Pham et al., 2019; \nVuong, 2013 ). The aquifers are namely Holocene (qh), Upper Pleistocene (qp3), Upper-middle Pleistocene (qp2\u20133), Lower Pleistocene \n(qp1), Middle Pliocene (n2\u20132), Lower Pliocene (n2\u20131), Upper Miocene (n1\u20133) and broadly distributed in the area with a thickness of 15m \nto more than 50m (Deltares, 2011; DWRPIS, 2009 ). The two cross sections (Fig. 2, NW-SE extending from the north to the coast and \nSW-NE going from Tien River to Hau river) provide an overview of the spatial distribution and interconnection of aquifer and aquitard \nsystems in the Tra Vinh area (Van Hiep and Van Long, 2017 ). Aquifer media are composed of sand and gravel with a mixture of clay \nand silt with medium to low water-transmitting capacity (Table 1). Groundwater quality in the Holocene aquifer (qh) is generally \nbelow the water quality standard due to the influence from the land use activities (Bui et al., 2017 ). The most developed aquifers are \nthe Upper Pleistocene aquifer (qp3) and Upper-Middle Pleistocene aquifer (qp2\u20133). \n2.2. Status of groundwater use and issues \nIn the Mekong Delta, groundwater is partially used in aquaculture and is widely used for domestic and industrial purposes since \n2000s. In the period of 2004 and 2008, groundwater abstraction almost doubled, due to a rapid growth in number of households using \ngroundwater for domestic activities (Sanh, 2010 ). The most recent report showed that about 224,773 m3\/day of groundwater was \nabstracted in whole province, mainly from qp3","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.8649096111}]},"Match":"YES"},{"Question":"How does the automatic salinity monitoring system work?","Answer":{"metadata":{"6e57b3ea-1503-4d54-847e-7b38791ed985":{"page_label":"6","file_name":"1-s2.0-S221458182300112X-main.pdf"},"31fbc7d4-f405-422c-b3e4-7b4309f12e1e":{"page_label":"11","file_name":"1-s2.0-S221458182300112X-main.pdf"}},"response":"\nThe automatic salinity monitoring system works by using field campaigns of EC measurements to measure the electrical conductivity (EC) values of domestic wells in the Tra Vinh province.

Salinity measurements \nField campaigns of EC measurements were carried out at a large number of domestic wells in the Tra Vinh province in the years of \n2017, 2018 and 2019, for the upper three aquifers. Students from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology were mobilized to \nmeasure EC values with EC meters guided by university lecturers. Local youth and women unions participated in the monitoring \ncampaigns. The number of EC measurements were 756, 86 and 180 in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Spatial distribution maps of \ngroundwater salinity were created to delineate the interfaces of fresh\/salt water in these three aquifers. Subsequently, a number of \nmonitoring wells were assigned along the interfaces to observe the changes of TDS concentration monthly. A participatory salinity \nmonitoring program was established in Tra Vinh province. \n2.4.2. Construction of groundwater models \nThe objectives of the numerical groundwater modeling were to enhance understanding of the conceptual model and provide a first \nestimate of spatial-temporal variations of groundwater levels (GWLs) and salinity distribution under scarce measurements. The \ngroundwater flow and saltwater intrusion models were constructed with popular model codes MODFLOW-2005 (Harbaugh, 2005 ) and \nSEAWAT (Dausman et al., 2009 ). The models were constructed with a conceptual model approach in groundwater modeling system \n(GMS10.4) (Kumar, 2012; Zhou and Li, 2011 ). The models consisted of 13 model layers corresponding to 7 aquifers and 6 aquitards. \nThe model grid is uniform with cell size of 500 by 500m. Model boundaries included coastal line, two rivers and upstream province \nboundary, which were all simulated as head-dependent flow boundaries. The hydrological stresses included recharge from precipi -\ntation infiltration in the top unconfined aquifer, interactions with surface water, and groundwater extractions. The models were \ntransient from 2007 to 2018 with monthly stress period. In the groundwater flow model, time series of GWL at 11 monitoring wells \nwere compared with simulated GWL during the calibration process (Fig. 1). In this process, hydraulic parameters were adjusted to \ncalibrate the model and obtain the best fit to observed GWL fluctuations based on the trial-and-error method. The saltwater transport \nmodel included advection, dispersion and density variations. The sources of saltwater were seawater and saltwater entrapped in the \naquifers. The initial TDS concentrations of the fresh and saline groundwater were assigned based on the Kriging interpolation maps of \nthe dataset of EC measurements and a spatial distribution map of saline groundwater was created to define the interface of fresh\/salt \nwater in three shallowest aquifers. Similarly, the trial-and-error method was applied to calibrate the salinity model based on the \ndataset of EC measurements and 1.5 years data of TDS observations at 5 locations of the qp2\u20133 aquifer (Fig. 1). During the calibration \nprocess, longitudinal dispersion and effective porosity were adjusted to obtain reasonable agreement between computed TDS and \nmonitoring ones. The details of modeling are described in another manuscript (Van et al., 2023 ). \n2.4.3. Selection of locations of monitoring wells \nThe main objectives of GWL monitoring are to characterize the regional groundwater regime, to assess impacts of groundwater \nabstractions, to identify interactions with surface water, and to detect trend of groundwater level declines.

These saltwater areas have been confirmed from salinity monitoring campaigns at pumping \nwells in 2017. It is relatively easier to monitor groundwater salinity from a large number of monitoring wells. Pumping wells with the \nwell screen located in a specific aquifer can be selected for measuring salinity with EC meters. Owners of wells are interested to \nmeasure EC values as volunteers within a framework of participatory monitoring systems. Awareness, education and training of using \nEC meters should be provided to volunteers (Office, 2011; Prouteau and Wolff, 2008 ). A protocol of quality control system is also \nimportant. Additional EC measurements can be obtained from groundwater level monitoring wells when installed. It is not necessary to \nmeasure EC values with a high frequency since groundwater salinity only shows gradual changes. EC measurements of twice a year, \none in dry period (December \u2013 April) and one in raining period (May \u2013 November) are good practice to begin with. Intensive mea-\nsurements of EC values can also help to improve saltwater transport model (Faneca S`anchez et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2019; Shin and \nHwang, 2020 ), and support the use of this tool for salinity control and mitigation (Abd-Elhamid et al., 2020; Altalmas, 2012; Huang \nand Chiu, 2018; Hussain et al., 2019 ). \n4.Conclusions \nGroundwater monitoring networks for Tra Vinh Province were designed for monitoring of groundwater level and salinity for \nFig. 9.Comparison of contour map of TDS in the qh aquifer: (a) from SEAWAT model at March 2016; (b) from Kriging interpolation of selected \nmonitoring wells. \nFig. 10.Comparison of contour map of TDS in the qp3 aquifer: (a) from SEAWAT model March 2016; (b) from Kriging interpolation of selected \nmonitoring wells.

The \nsensor measures the water tension in the soil which negates the need to \ncalibrate for soil type (Stirzaker et al., 2017 ). Three coloured lights \nindicate soil moisture status with blue as \u2018wet\u2019 (0 to \u000022 kPa), green as \n\u2018moist \u2019 (\u000022 to \u000050 kPa) and red indicates \u2018dry\u2019 (>\u000050 kPa) soil. Use of \nthe Chameleon sensor has allowed Tanzanian farmers to implement \nirrigation schedules based on quantitative data that saves significant \namounts of water by reducing the frequency and duration of watering \n(Mdemu et al., 2020 ). The adoption of the Chameleon has also created \nsocial benefits among farmer groups by generating conversation and \nawareness of improved irrigation schedules (Moyo et al., 2020 ). The \nimplementation of the Chameleon soil moisture sensor in the MRD \nmight limit soil salinisation by reducing the frequency of use of saline \nirrigation water. Used in conjunction with mulching and alternative \ncrops that have a high water use efficiency (WUE) and saline tolerance, \nthe Chameleon might provide a suitable management option for opti-\nmising the implementation of alternative crops in the MRD dry season. \n4.2. Drainage \nSalinity damage to plants can be minimised by removing excess sa-\nline water via effective drainage. Increased shoot Na+and Cl\u0000concen -\ntrations can occur due to an interaction between waterlogging and \nsalinity (Barrett-Lennard, 2003 ). Waterlogged rice paddy may also have \nnegative impacts on the subsequent emergence and establishment of \nalternative crops sown at the end of the rainy He-Thu season. Raised bed \nsystems provide adequate drainage options for waterlogging sensitive \nplants and can help reduce the effects of salinity. In Bangladesh, a raised \nbed system combined with mulch produced ~70% more potato tubers \nthan flat ground with no mulch (Islam et al., 2018 ). The use of drainage \npipes can have similar benefits to raised beds (Feng et al., 2017 ). Sub-\nsurface drainage is known to remove excess saline water and helps \nreduce long-term soil salinisation (Smedema et al., 2000 ). Whilst the \nbenefits of raised beds and drainage in reducing soil salinity levels are \nabundant, labour intensiveness must be considered when recommend -\ning their use in the MRD. Mechanisation is increasing in popularity in \nthe MRD with a recent farmer survey indicating that one rotary tiller \nwith a walking tractor exists for every 7 ha of rice produced (Nguyen \net al., 2020a ). As an example of mechanisation, over half a million tractors were used in agricultural production in Vietnam in 2013 \n(Nguyen et al., 2016 ). \n4.3. Seed preparation \nSeed priming is a pre-sowing treatment that can help alleviate the \nnegative effects of salinity where seeds are soaked for up to 12 h in \nsolutions including NaCl, CaCl 2 and KCl prior to sowing (Chen et al., \n2021 ; Ashraf and Foolad, 2005 ). This simple technique has improved \ngermination, plant establishment and plant growth by initiating imbi-\nbition and activating metabolic processes (Ashraf and Foolad, 2005 ). \nSuccess across a multitude of crops has been reported with improved \ngermination rates in maize (Ashraf and Rauf, 2001 ), sorghum (Chen \net al., 2021 ) and quinoa (Yang et al., 2018 ). However, alternative crops \nin the MRD are planted at the end of the wet season when soil salinity is \nlow, thus seed priming is of less relevance. \nAn alternative seed preparation technique that mitigates the","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.870513781},{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":3622,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"9","file_name":"1-s2.0-S0308521X23000379-main.pdf"},"hash":"f5e16ceee5676a19e5fd1c1472cd59000110ba0c390872f0c5f2d5f87830e68c","id_":"4906380c-44c0-415b-a8a8-d2e8cd8fddcc","metadata":{"page_label":"9","file_name":"1-s2.0-S0308521X23000379-main.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":{"hash":"f90362e69390c7d4222a62e7f38268840162485b5459a4a5507dc11a4f93b6bd","metadata":{"page_label":"9","file_name":"1-s2.0-S0308521X23000379-main.pdf"},"node_id":"44f76952-6a11-41c3-b0c9-74a753c81843","node_type":null},"node_id":"4906380c-44c0-415b-a8a8-d2e8cd8fddcc","node_info":{"start":0,"end":3622},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":null,"ref_doc_id":"651892c7-8de1-4f9e-8a0c-c880ed38ae60","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"4010a3d0bb65b746a48fc25d638d9c9d3c01826ea2050ceb1a7d0f90e5f60e74","metadata":{"page_label":"9","file_name":"1-s2.0-S0308521X23000379-main.pdf"},"node_id":"651892c7-8de1-4f9e-8a0c-c880ed38ae60","node_type":null},"3":{"hash":"f90362e69390c7d4222a62e7f38268840162485b5459a4a5507dc11a4f93b6bd","metadata":{"page_label":"9","file_name":"1-s2.0-S0308521X23000379-main.pdf"},"node_id":"44f76952-6a11-41c3-b0c9-74a753c81843","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"4010a3d0bb65b746a48fc25d638d9c9d3c01826ea2050ceb1a7d0f90e5f60e74","metadata":{"page_label":"9","file_name":"1-s2.0-S0308521X23000379-main.pdf"},"node_id":"651892c7-8de1-4f9e-8a0c-c880ed38ae60","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":0,"text":"Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n9suitable alternative crop would have more green, less orange and min-\nimal to no red. This assessment framework highlights several potentially \nsuitable alternative crops including quinoa, cowpea and mustard greens, \ndespite the lack of a current market. A crop like soybean that has rela-\ntively poor salt tolerance and high-water use is less suitable despite an \nexisting market. It is important to note that various crops may suit \ndifferent regions of the MRD where water scarcity or saline intrusion \nmay vary (Tran et al., 2018a ). \n4.Alternative management practices \nImplementing various management techniques can provide a cost- \neffective way to reduce the effects of salinity and maximise production \nof dry season alternative crops. Conserving soil moisture, monitoring \nirrigation, and establishing effective drainage are well proven manage -\nment options that can be used in conjunction with a suitable replace -\nment crop. \n4.1. Soil moisture conservation \nImplementing management techniques that retain soil moisture can \ndecrease the need for frequent irrigation and, where the irrigation water \nis saline, reduce a crop \u2019s consequent exposure to salinity. This can be \ndone via the use of soil surface mulches or soil moisture monitoring \ndevices. \n4.1.1. Mulching \nMulching with organic materials is an effective way to maintain soil moisture (Abd El-Mageed et al., 2016 ), reduce evaporation (Fu et al., \n2018 ), slow capillary rise and reduce the concentration of surface salt \n(Song et al., 2020 ). Straw mulch is a cheap, biodegradable soil covering \nmethod that has been used by many producers throughout Asia to limit \nthe effects of salinity. The benefits of mulch in relation to soil salinity, \nsoil moisture and yield are summarised in Table 3. \nPlastic coverings can decrease evaporation, increase yields, decrease \npesticide runoff (Steinmetz et al., 2016 ) and assist with the adverse ef-\nfects of transient salinity (Barrett-Lennard et al., 2021 ). Plastic mulches \nare beneficial for increasing soil temperatures in cool climates (Lin et al., \n2016 ; Dong et al., 2008 ), however this is not an issue in the MRD. The \nmajority of plastic mulches are polyethylene based and non- \nbiodegradable, thus the environmental implications of using plastic \nmulch must be carefully considered (Kasirajan and Ngouajio, 2012 ). \nResearch into biodegradable plastic mulches and microorganisms that \ndecompose plastic is still developing (Shah and Wu, 2020 ). \n4.1.2. Soil moisture monitoring \nFlooded rice production has dominated the MRD and thus there is a \nlack of knowledge regarding irrigation schedules for upland crops. \nMonitoring soil moisture throughout the dry season can help producers \ndevelop an irrigation schedule that will improve WUE and minimise the \namount of saline water applied. Tensiometers can be an effective tool to \nmonitor soil moisture and apply irrigation at the required time to \nmaintain adequate soil moisture, although they are not readily available \nto producers in the MRD. Successful monitoring of soil moisture in the \nMRD is dependent on affordable and easy to use devices.

This will cause severe environmen -\ntal consequences because salinity can be detrimental to agriculture, aquaculture and human consumption. Tidal dynamics \nare important in regulating salinity in river deltas. However, there is still uncertainty about the influence of different tidal \namplitudes on deltas\u2019 salinity. This paper investigates the impact of various tidal amplitudes on the spatiotemporal salinity \ndistribution in deltas through three-dimensional idealized modelling. Numerical simulations are carried out with a common \nhydrograph and different tidal ranges. Both tide-influenced and river-dominated cases were considered. Results suggest that \nsmall increases in the tidal amplitude in river-dominated or low tidal regimes cases can have positive effects against salini -\nzation. Tide-induced mixing helps to increase freshwater areas and volumes. The water in the delta remains fresh for longer \nperiods in scenarios representative of microtidal regimes. Further increases in the tidal amplitude to meso- and macrotidal \nlevels reverse these effects and reduce freshwater areas and volumes. Results were used to test how salinity correlates with \nchannel orders and river discharge in the presence of tides. These correlations are controlled more by bathymetry than tidal \nforcing. This study provides important insights into how changes in tidal range could impact spatiotemporal salinity distri -\nbutions in deltas.\nKeywords  Salinity\u00a0\u00b7 River deltas\u00a0\u00b7 T idal amplitude\u00a0\u00b7 River discharge\u00a0\u00b7 Idealized modelling\nIntroduction\nRiver deltas are coastal ecosystems with highly fertile soils \nand productive waters and are attractive places for living and \nworking with dense populations and high economic activity \n(Ericson et\u00a0al. 2006 ; Fagherazzi et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2015 ; Bianchi 2016 ; \nNicholls et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2018 ). Climate change challenges the sustain -\nability and maintenance of deltaic systems worldwide.Sea level rise (SLR) increases the salinity in deltaic \nregions and causes an upstream intrusion of the tidal salt -\nwater zone (Gornitz\u00a0 1991 ; Bhuiyan and Dutta\u00a0 2012 ; Hong  \nand Shen\u00a0 2012 ; Hong et\u00a0al. 2020 ; Bricheno et\u00a0al. 2021 ). Salt -\nwater intrusion (SWI) is an important phenomenon in coastal  \nzones that is driven by both anthropogenic (e.g. groundwater  \nextraction) and natural (e.g. tidal inundation) factors (White and  \nKaplan, 2017 ; Rahman et\u00a0al., 2019 ) and causes serious \nproblems in households, agriculture, irrigation and industry \n(Allison\u00a0 1964 ; Smedema and Shiati\u00a0 2002 ; Zhang et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2011 ). \nSalinization contaminates rivers, aquifers and soils decreas -\ning freshwater storage and water quality (Gornitz\u00a0 1991 ). \nHigh salinity reduces soil fertility resulting in low crop yield \n(Bhuiyan and Dutta\u00a0 2012 ).

Scenario Development\nFuture scenarios were developed based on the analysis of changes in upstream dis-\ncharge and water levels by referencing the latest of\ufb01cial report by MONRE and previous\nstudies [ 12,13,42,61]. According to monitoring data, during the period 2015\u20132020, the\naverage hourly river discharge in the dry season at Can Tho and My Thuan decreased\nby 417 m3\/s and 426 m3\/s, respectively. Furthermore, it was estimated that the average\nhourly river discharge in the dry season at Can Tho and My Thuan will change by \u2212128%\nand\u2212117% during the period 2020\u20132050, respectively (Table 1). A previous study indicated\nthat the average \ufb02ow from Can Tho and My Thuan was projected to change from \u221280%\nto\u2212100% with a sea level rise of 35 cm in the dry season between periods 2009\u20132011 and\n2036\u20132065 [ 13]. It can be estimated that the average sea level rise could be about 0.88 cm\nper year (i.e., 26 cm between 2020 and 2050) in the VMD. In addition, the sea level in the\nVMD was projected to increase from 22 cm to 26 cm in the 2050s compared to 2013 (i.e.,\n0.59 to 0.74 cm per year) under the climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 [ 42]. Other\nstudies suggest that the water level could increase by 0.55 cm per year [ 61,62]; therefore, it\nis reasonable to assume that the sea level in 2050 could increase by approximately 17 cm\nrelative to 2020 levels. However, according to MONRE [ 12], sea level rise was projected to\nrange from 23 to 28 cm by 2050 compared to the baseline period (1986\u20132005) under RCP2.6,\nRCP24.5, and RCP8.5. Thus, it is estimated that by mid-century, sea level rise would range\nbetween 0.46 and 0.56 cm per year (between 14 and 17 cm in the period 2020\u20132050). In\nthis study, reliable scenarios were developed to assess the impacts of sea level rise and\nupstream discharge reduction during the dry season, including sea level increases of 17, 22,\nand 26 cm combined with discharge reduction ranging from 80% to 128% (Table 1).\nTable 1.

Rice will start to incur yield losses at 2 g L\u00001 (Grattan et al., \n2002 ) and even salt tolerant varieties will suffer grain quality defects at \n3 to 4 g L\u00001 (Qin et al., 2020 ). Consequently, plants that can either \ntolerate salinity during the reproductive stages of growth, or plants that \ncan be harvested early will be more suitable as alternative crops. \nAre there prospective salt tolerant crops for the MRD? Field trials of \npossible crops are just starting, but there are promising and notable \nalternative crops of whom demonstrate various cellular physiological \nmechanisms for tolerating salinity exposure. Salt-tolerant varieties of \ncowpea (Vigna unguiculata ) appear to osmotically adjust by accumu -\nlating greater concentrations of Na+in their roots during vegetative \nstages to minimise salinity damage (Le et al., 2021 ). The upregulated \nproduction of proteins involved in photorespiratory pathways also oc-\ncurs in cowpea plants exposed to salinity (De Abreu et al., 2014 ). Quinoa \n(Chenopodium quinoa) can withstand high levels of salinity due to its \nhalophytic nature and efficiency in excluding Na+from its leaves (Cai \nand Gao, 2020 ). In fact, quinoa has shown to have increased biomass \nand yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline \nconditions (Hariadi et al., 2011 ; Jacobsen et al., 2003 ). Characterisa -\ntion of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) involved in salt sensory \nmechanisms has occurred in quinoa (Maughan et al., 2009 ) with the \nplant demonstrating the ability to rapidly sequester salt into the vacuole \nto prevent the accumulation of cytoplasmic Na+(Cai and Gao, 2020 ). An \noverexpression of the SOS1 gene was also found in saline tolerant \nmustard greens (Brassica juncea) that was associated with an increased sequestration of Na+in roots (Singh et al., 2019 ).

A basic structure of a drilled well includes a well casing, cap a nd screen, \nas well as a pitless adaptor and a pump. Well casings are tube -like in shape and keep the integrity \nof the surrounding soil. They also act as a barrier to prevent dirt and contaminants from entering \nthe water. Well screens and caps attach to the  top and bottom of the well casing, respectively, \nand act to keep the water free from debris. However, well caps also include a valve to control the \npressure of the well casing. The pitless adapter allows the casing to descend past the frost line \nand maint ain a seal.  \nFinally, there are two types of pumps that are commonly used to transport water. Jet \npumps are used for dug wells with a depth of less than 25 feet. They utilize suction to pump the \nwater. For deeper wells, like driven or drilled wells, submers ible pumps are used.

This equation demonstrates that decreased precipitation in one area has the potential to \ncontribute to the water level of an aquifer miles away . \nAs described in Section 1.3.4, humans pump water out of aquifers for use in industry, \nagriculture, and domestic uses. When water is used at a rate higher than the recharge rate, \naquifers become depleted unless water is artificially introduced to offset t he demand. This can be \ndone by redirecting water across land areas using rivers, canals, irrigation basins, or sprinkler \nsystems. A long -term planning approach to maintaining aquifer levels is called aquifer storage \nand recovery. This involves storing wate r in wells that can be pumped into aquifers during dry \nperiods (USGS, n.d. -b). \n \n1.3.3 Groundwater Wells  \n There are a variety of purposes that communities utilize groundwater for, as detailed in \nSection 1.3.4. The most common way to access groundwater is through drilling a well and \npumping the groundwater up to the surface. There are three main types of wells depending on the \nmethod that is used to dig them (Waller, 1982).  \nThe simplest type of well is a dug well. These are constructed manual ly using hand tools \nor equipment such as a backhoe. In order to use this method, the ground must be relatively soft, \nand the water table must be shallow. These wells expose a large surface area of the aquifer and \nare used to reach water trapped in less per meable materials like very fine sand, silt, or clay. \nTypically, dug wells are only 10 to 30 feet deep (EPA, n.d. -d). This shallow depth combined \nwith an exposed surface area makes them at a higher risk for contamination, and they are very \nsusceptible to ch anges in drought conditions (Waller, 1982).  \nA second type of well is a driven well. They are created by driving a pipe into the ground. \nThis pipe has a relatively small diameter of about 2 inches (IDPH, 2011) and usually has a screen \nto filter out the soft  soil. Driven wells tend to be 30 to 50 feet deep and are used in areas with \nthick sand and gravel deposits (USEPA, n.d. -e). Similar to dug wells, these work best for \nrelatively shallow water (water table within 15 feet of the surface) and are at high risk  for \ncontamination (Waller, 1982.

Coastal \nregions see high le vels of flooding specifically caused by storm surges and sea level rise, \nresulting in coastal surface water sources and aquifers facing issues in water quality. As coastal \nflooding occurs more frequently, an increased volume of saltwater is introduced into  coastal \naquifers and surface water sources (Mahmoodzadeh and Karamouz, 2017). Studies done on \npublic health issues after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita proved that storm surges \ncontaminated freshwater aquifers, and studies done in the northern Cook Islands  two years after \na category 5 cyclone showed atoll freshwater lenses (surface water sources) took between 11 to \n26 months to recover. An additional study showed that moderate storms impact groundwater \nflow and water transport in coastal systems. Thi s study showed that the occurrence of a tropical \nstorm 2000 m south of a Georgia salt marsh caused the marsh\u2019s creek water to move more than \n25 m from the creek bank at depths greater than 5 m (Mahmoodzadeh and Karamouz, 2017).  \n \n1.4.3 Impacts of Droughts o n Saltwater Intrusion  \nAs droughts occur worldwide with increased intensity and duration, the levels of \ngroundwater in aquifers in affected areas have decreased. This decrease in groundwater is caused \nby both a lack of rain during droughts and the removal of water from aquifers faster than it can \nbe recharged. During droughts, aquifers are recharged much slower because there is no rainwater  \nseeping into the ground and entering into aquifers (USGS, n.d. -h). Because of this issue, aquifers \nby the coast can be recharged with saltwat er during droughts.  \nThe occurrence of saltwater intrusion in aquifers has increased significantly in the U.S. \ndue to droughts occurring across the country. Saltwater intrusion caused by droughts has been an \nissue in California since 1946. In 1946, the firs t documented report of saltwater intrusion in the \nstate was sent out from a farming center in the Salinas Valley (Walton, 2019).

Appendix A presents the reported correlation\ncoefficients and plots of in situ data at different soil depths against the salinity index measured\nfor April 2016, March 2016 and the period of November 2015 to April 2016.\nThere exist two caveats for our identification. First, for missing data of river salinity not re-\nported by stations, which are detectable in figure 4, we assign zeros for stations that reported rel-\natively low average salinity for available periods and keep the missing values of stations which\non average reported higher level of salinity such as those in Bac Lieu province. To our knowl-\nedge, hydro-stations base on a number of environmental factors such as temperature and pre-\ncipitation to determine the start of the dry season. The measure of river salinity only starts with\nthe observed onset of the dry season and thus in most cases, non-recorded data reflect marginal\nor zero salinity intrusion. The second caveat follows that in practice there are sluice gates in\nMKD river and irrigation canal systems, which can be closed to slow the intrusion of saltwater.\nYet due to the lack of data on the locations of sluice gates, this factor is not accounted for in our\nidentification of using canal distance to characterize salinity dispersion. Nevertheless, we also\nargue that because the operation of sluice gates is likely correlated with the development of lo-\ncal agricultural production, the inclusion of this factor in the construction of SI may introduce\nendogeneity problem.\n3.2 Economic Outcome Variables\nHousehold Data.

Droughts pose a significant threat \nto agricultural communities as global warming continues to progress. Crop failures are inevitable \nin a drought and have the potential to impact countr ies across the globe (The World Bank, 2012). \nFor example, in 2012, prices for maize and soybeans reached an unprecedented high in the \nsummer due to a large number of droughts in both the United States and Eastern Europe. The \nWorld Bank organization reporte d that global food prices increased by 10% and in response, \nfood insecurity rates increased as well (The World Bank, 2012).  \nAnother anticipated risk during droughts is that hydroelectric power may become \ninaccessible. The demand for electricity increases with temperature as people are inclined to \nwant to use AC units and fans to keep their living areas cool. This demand, however, puts stress \non the electrical supply grid because the water used to produce electricity evaporates in drought \nconditio ns (Eaton, 2012).  \n \n1.2.6 Impacts on Coastal Environments  \nAs described previously, climate change results in sea level rise and an increase in the \nfrequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and tropical \nstorms.

Damage to constructed facilities such as homes, roads, \nand wastewater treatment facilities (which are sited proximate to surface wate rs) also occurs.  \nSea level changes and storm events also lead to movement of the saltwater -freshwater \ninterface inland. Saltwater encroachment can contaminate surface water sources, turning them \nbrackish. Encroachment also impacts aquifer recharge, eventua lly leading to saltwater intrusion \nin subsurface water sources.

ISSUES OF THE LMB IRRIGATION SECTOR  \n \nThis section focuses on major issues of the LMB irrigation sector that need to  be addressed , \ni.e. the impacts of climate change, natural disasters  and irrigation development , and those \nregarding  irrigation project management in the LMB.   \n \n3.1 The i mpact  of climate change and natural disasters   \n \nThe LMB experiences  drought and flood almost every year. These natural disasters  not only  \nreduce crop production , but also damage irrigation structures  such as  dams, weirs , and canals.  \n Given the variability of rainfall throughout the year, many areas in the LMB are subject to \ndrought risk. The form of drought varies such as  in the onset of wet season rainfall, duration \nand quantity  of rainfall in different areas, the onset of the dry season, and the occurrence of \nperiods without rain during  the wet season. Areas with drought risk but insufficient irrigable \nland lacked  sufficient  water resources for agriculture  (MRC, 2018c ). \n Flash floods are frequent around Tonle Sap and in mountainous and hilly regions of the LMB. Pluvial flooding can occur on a localized basis across the B asin as a result of heavy rainfall. \nHowever, fluvia flooding is  the most important and potentially damaging form of flooding , \nand is the focus for the analysis here (MRC, 2018c). In particular, severe  flood  events  often \nbreak irrigation structure s, interrupt  the water supply to fields , and lower their storage and \ndrainage capacity .  \n Salinity intrusion in the Lower  Mekong Delta is known to extend more than 50 km inland \nduring the dry season, which affects  almost  2 million ha of land . Salinity is a serious constraint \nto agriculture , and rice yields are negatively affected by high salini ty levels (MRC, 2018c). In \nparticular, s alinity intrusion is a serious problem for Viet Nam, which is caused by water level \nreduction in the Mekong River or sea level rising, and deteriorates the  quality of drinking and \nindustrial water.  \n People in the LMB also fear the impact  of climate change on agriculture , because it  may \nexacerbate  the damages  caused by  drought, flood , and salinity  intrusion.   \n 3.1.1 Climate change  \nIt is widely recognized that climate change is a result of the influence of human activities increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Across the LMB, climat e \nchange is also evident with rising temperatures, changing precipitation  patterns , and rising \nsea levels above  the historical record.   \n The Mekong River Basin has already been influenced by climate change. The trends and step changes are evident in the 1981 \u20132010 baseline period, with conditions in the latter part of \nthe baseline period hotter and drier than they were at the start (MRC, 2017): \n \n\uf0fc Average annual basin -wide temperatures have increased over the historical record .","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.858116526}]},"Match":"YES"},{"Question":"How are grey-green solutions perceived by water managers in the context of water resource management?","Answer":{"metadata":{"707ea841-4ef1-4105-8c31-20e8658d64a4":{"page_label":"1","file_name":"Water retention for agricultural resilience in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta towards integrated grey green solutions.pdf"},"ccecbc53-4d9b-4d74-9833-5883a573ddf6":{"page_label":"1","file_name":"Water retention for agricultural resilience in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta towards integrated grey green solutions.pdf"}},"response":"\nGrey-green solutions are perceived by water managers as an important complement to grey solutions, with the potential to address multiple water challenges.

This framing gives greater weight to grey solutions to tackle human- and \nclimate change-driven water problems such as floods, coastal erosion and saltwater \nintrusion (van Staveren & van Tatenhove, 2016 ). In general, grey solutions give \npriority to hard infrastructures (e.g., dykes), which are believed by decision-makers \nto be highly effective due to their immediate response to acute risks. For most \ndeveloping countries, grey solutions are commonly adopted for achieving water \nsecurity and management (Muller et al., 2015 ). However, this approach has several \ndrawbacks. In coastal zones for example, it can alter coastal morphology, leading \nto changes in ecosystems (Charoenlerkthawin et al., 2022 ). In addition to the high \ncost of grey-led water management (Santoro et al., 2019 ), there remain concerns \nover whether\/how grey solutions can address water challenges in the long term \n(Browder et al., 2019 ; Collentine & Futter, 2018 ).\nMuch has been discussed on the role of green infrastructure in addressing today\u2019s \nclimatic- and human-driven disturbances. The concept of green infrastructure sheds \nlights on how green assets and ecological systems can help sustain society and build \nresilience, making it a \u2018society\u2019s natural life system\u2019 (Cilliers, 2019 ). Akin to nature- \nbased solutions (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2019 ) and embedded ecosystem services \n(Cook & Spray, 2012 ) which support adaptation in times of altered social\u2013ecological \nrelationships (Palomo et al., 2021 ), green infrastructure has gained wider acceptance \nin addressing multiple water challenges (Collentine & Futter, 2018 ). For example, it \nhelps mitigate rainfall and drought extremes. It is also a vital component of water, \nflood, and agriculture management programmes (Browder et al., 2019 ; Cook et al.,  \n2016 ). Green infrastructure is increasingly recognized as an important complement \nto grey solutions (Everard et al., 2021 ), with some arguing the need to realize the \ninterconnections between the natural and built environment and to enjoy the \naggregate benefits of the two approaches (Singhvi et al., 2022 ). These arguments \nposit that nature-based solutions have limits, and that judicious integration with \ntechnical management will be needed to ensure water security, and particularly with \nregards to agricultural sustainability (Staccione et al., 2021 ). While their benefits are \nrecognized, not much is known about how integrated solutions might support water \nretention for enhancing agricultural resilience in the water scarcity context of \nthe VMD.\nThere remains insufficient understanding of how grey\u2013green solutions are perceived \nby those involved in water resource management, especially concerning water retention \nfor agricultural resilience in the VMD. This gap raises concerns over the persistence of \ntechnical management in the context of multiple, compounding water challenges (e.g., \nwater disruptions, droughts and saltwater intrusion) in the long term (Tran et al., 2021b ). \nThe present study investigates this knowledge gap by examining: (1) how \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 \nsolutions are perceived by water managers through discussion of contemporary water \nmanagement practices, (2) how the integrated approaches inform household and institu -\ntional decisions to implement\/expand water retention across multiple scales (e.g., farm, \nhousehold, and landscape), and (3) how these \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 solutions might contribute to \nagricultural resilience.4\n T.

Historical accounts indicate \nthat the region has seldom experienced similar water-scarce situations (Lee & Dang, 2019 ; \nNguyen et al., 2021 ). The primary causes are perceived to be associated with coupled \nclimate-development impacts (Hecht et al., 2019 ). These issues place mounting pressures \non the successful implementation of the climate-resilient and sustainable development \nstrategies as mandated by Resolution 120 (The Vietnamese Government, 2017 ). This \ndocument was issued in 2017, seeking to guide the national government\u2019s directions \non implementing climate-resilient and sustainable development in the VMD. Overall, its \ndevelopment agenda embraces long-term visions, objectives, overall solutions as well as \nconcrete tasks to improve economic development while prioritizing adaptation to climate \nchange in the delta (The Vietnamese Government, 2017 ). While this flagship document \nsketches out strategic plans to achieve key climate and development missions, far less \nattention has been given to water security and water retention options to support \nagricultural production in the delta.\nDemands for water retention suggest how \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 solutions help tackle water \nscarcity. These integrated approaches are conceptualized as a spectrum, combining \u2018hard\u2019 \nand \u2018soft\u2019 interventions, \u2018grey\u2019 and \u2018green\u2019 infrastructure, \u2018engineered\u2019 and \u2018nature-based \nsolutions\u2019 (Singhvi et al., 2022 ). Previous studies have examined how \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 solu -\ntions provide pathways towards achieving water security and climate change adaptation \n(Everard et al., 2021 ; Kapetas & Fenner, 2020 ). For example, V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al. (2021 ) \nsuggest that combining natural capital (green) with engineering-based (grey) approaches \nplays an essential role in addressing water security threats. While these solutions have \nbeen largely deployed in water management in countries in the Global South (Everard et \nal., 2021 ), technical water management approaches have received greater priority for \nagricultural production in the VMD (Vo, 2012 ). However, such singular approaches do not \nguarantee an adequate supply of water for the agricultural development in the delta\u2019s \nnew water contexts, which are increasingly dominated by climate change and upstream \nhydropower development (Hui et al., 2022 ).\nAgainst this background, this paper investigates how water scarcity emerges as a \ncritical concern in water management, and how it can be addressed to enhance agricul -\ntural resilience in the VMD. It looks into water retention solutions, and ways they could be \nintegrated into the national water governance framework for agricultural development. \nThe paper focuses on two distinct ecological zones in the VMD: An Giang (upper delta) \nand Ben Tre (lower delta), by examining their water scarcity problems and respective \nwater retention solutions undertaken on the ground. To elaborate on these cases, we \nrespond to the following questions:\n\u25cfHow do the emerging water conditions generate risks perceived by rural societies?\n\u25cfHow has the paradigm shift in water management taken place in the case studies?\n\u25cfHow is water retention undertaken at farm, household, and landscape scales?\n\u25cfHow would the integrated \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 solutions be deployed for agricultural resi-\nlience in the delta?\nBased on insights drawn from extensive desk reviews, stakeholder workshops and inter -\nviews with key informants in the study sites, this paper argues that present and future 2\n T.

This framing gives greater weight to grey solutions to tackle human- and \nclimate change-driven water problems such as floods, coastal erosion and saltwater \nintrusion (van Staveren & van Tatenhove, 2016 ). In general, grey solutions give \npriority to hard infrastructures (e.g., dykes), which are believed by decision-makers \nto be highly effective due to their immediate response to acute risks. For most \ndeveloping countries, grey solutions are commonly adopted for achieving water \nsecurity and management (Muller et al., 2015 ). However, this approach has several \ndrawbacks. In coastal zones for example, it can alter coastal morphology, leading \nto changes in ecosystems (Charoenlerkthawin et al., 2022 ). In addition to the high \ncost of grey-led water management (Santoro et al., 2019 ), there remain concerns \nover whether\/how grey solutions can address water challenges in the long term \n(Browder et al., 2019 ; Collentine & Futter, 2018 ).\nMuch has been discussed on the role of green infrastructure in addressing today\u2019s \nclimatic- and human-driven disturbances. The concept of green infrastructure sheds \nlights on how green assets and ecological systems can help sustain society and build \nresilience, making it a \u2018society\u2019s natural life system\u2019 (Cilliers, 2019 ). Akin to nature- \nbased solutions (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2019 ) and embedded ecosystem services \n(Cook & Spray, 2012 ) which support adaptation in times of altered social\u2013ecological \nrelationships (Palomo et al., 2021 ), green infrastructure has gained wider acceptance \nin addressing multiple water challenges (Collentine & Futter, 2018 ). For example, it \nhelps mitigate rainfall and drought extremes. It is also a vital component of water, \nflood, and agriculture management programmes (Browder et al., 2019 ; Cook et al.,  \n2016 ). Green infrastructure is increasingly recognized as an important complement \nto grey solutions (Everard et al., 2021 ), with some arguing the need to realize the \ninterconnections between the natural and built environment and to enjoy the \naggregate benefits of the two approaches (Singhvi et al., 2022 ). These arguments \nposit that nature-based solutions have limits, and that judicious integration with \ntechnical management will be needed to ensure water security, and particularly with \nregards to agricultural sustainability (Staccione et al., 2021 ). While their benefits are \nrecognized, not much is known about how integrated solutions might support water \nretention for enhancing agricultural resilience in the water scarcity context of \nthe VMD.\nThere remains insufficient understanding of how grey\u2013green solutions are perceived \nby those involved in water resource management, especially concerning water retention \nfor agricultural resilience in the VMD. This gap raises concerns over the persistence of \ntechnical management in the context of multiple, compounding water challenges (e.g., \nwater disruptions, droughts and saltwater intrusion) in the long term (Tran et al., 2021b ). \nThe present study investigates this knowledge gap by examining: (1) how \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 \nsolutions are perceived by water managers through discussion of contemporary water \nmanagement practices, (2) how the integrated approaches inform household and institu -\ntional decisions to implement\/expand water retention across multiple scales (e.g., farm, \nhousehold, and landscape), and (3) how these \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 solutions might contribute to \nagricultural resilience.4\n T.

Our data suggest how the integrated \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 solutions can be harnessed to \naddress water challenges across the study areas. While grey solutions (e.g., dykes, reser -\nvoirs) remain essential to retain water on a large scale, the non-dyke (e.g., deep flooding) \nareas in the periphery of An Giang province can allow the absorption of large amounts of \nfloodwater in the flood season. These integrated approaches not only allow local farmers \nto practise a wide range of farming systems such as floating (deep-water) rice or inte -\ngrated farming systems (rice\u2013fish; Phong et al., 2022 ), but they also supply water for \nadjacent jurisdictions, those frequently exposed to water scarcity during the dry season. In \nthis light, the hydrological expert advocated that \u2018Water retained in the floodplains should \nbe shared with downstream zones [coastal zones]\u2019 (interview, June 2022). Concerning the \ngrey water management solution through the case of the North Vam Nao scheme in An \nGiang province, while dykes can prevent floodwaters from high floods, they can be used \nto store floodwater in compartments in times of drought or water disruptions (Tran et al.,  \n2020 ). Here, the uptake of floodwaters into the scheme\u2019s compartments during the flood \nseason allowed the production of various farming systems (e.g., rice\u2013fish system), which \ngenerates greater income for rural households.\nWhile the role of grey infrastructure for water management is confirmed, green \ninfrastructure provides ecological functions that are essential for water retention. \nThorslund et al.

CONCLUSION  \n \nThe MRC expects that its Member Countries  will utilize the Guidance for reference when they plan \nnew irrigation projects  and improve existing ones . The Guidance shows  the techniques and \ntechnologies to address  the issues in the irrigation sector of the LMB.  \nThe MRC recommends  that its Member Countries  select and utilize the techniques  and technologies \nin accordance with their  level of irrigation development and the challenges that they are currently \nfacing.  \nHowever, MRC Member Countries  may need to test their selected methods and technologies before \nutilizing them nationwide. Therefore, the MRC  need s to conduct pilot testing of the  techniques  and \ntechnologies in the selected sites with the Member Countries , examine the effect s, and draft manuals \non them so that each  MRC Member Countries  would be able to introduce  them into their respective  \ncountry .   \nIn addition, the Member Countries  need to build  the capacities  farmers and local governments in  \nutilizing the methods and technologies based on the drafted manuals in order to disse minate them \nnationwide.

These findings are evident in both \nshallow and deep aquifers concurrently. The freshening event presumably happened in the last marine regression phase 60\u201312 ka BP, \nespecially during the LGM when sea levels were extremely low (Fig. 11a), which would explain groundwater ages in that range (Pham \net al., 2019 ). \nThe formation of large-scale impermeable Holocene aquitards, particularly QP3, between 8 and 6 ka BP prevented extensive \nseawater intrusion, which otherwise would have been expected due to rapidly rising sea levels in the Holocene transgression phase \n(Fig. 11b) and would have also led to the respective salinization signatures, namely Na+\/Cl- <0.86 and associated water types. The \nphenomenon of Pleistocene freshwater conservation can also be observed in other coastal areas worldwide (Cohen et al., 2010; \nDelsman et al., 2014 ; Han et al., 2020 ; Post and Kooi, 2003 ; van Engelen et al., 2021 ). However, such salinization signatures are \npresent at a few locations. Due to the high groundwater exploitation rates as well as the high hydraulic connectivity within and \napparently across the aquifers it is rather unlikely that these samples reflect remnants of older saline groundwater unaffected by the \nlatest freshening event. Furthermore, these samples plot below the conservative mixing line at low to moderate EC levels, which \nindicates that they developed from freshwater and are in an early stage of salinization (Fig. 8) rather than in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, as it is the case for same samples of Na-Cl type above the mixing line. Therefore, it is more likely that former freshwater \nmixed with saline water more recently. However, the origin of this recent salinization is not further examined in this study, but it \nshould be noted that the MD was completely inundated at around 5.5 ka BP and CMP until estimated 2 ka BP (Fig. 11c) (Nguyen et al., \n2000; Pham et al., 2019 ). The current stratification with high-density Holocene saline aquifers on top of low-density deep freshwater \naquifers reflects an unstable aquifer situation, which might lead to a downward migration of the younger saline groundwater along \nnatural and anthropogenic pathways (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Post and Kooi, 2003 ). It must be noted that the subsurface in \nthe study region is virtually perforated with abandoned as well as active wells of different construction quality and reliability. \nThe Piper diagram (Fig. 4) shows that in average the proportion of Na+is notably higher in Pliocene than in Pleistocene samples, \nwhich is illustrated in Fig. 11c. This finding might indicate the heterogeneous downwards migration of saline water from top to \nbottom, which leads to the release of divalent cations in Pleistocene aquifers, which therefore show a wide range of Na+(%). In \naddition, differences in geomorphology and discontinuities in the stratigraphy probably resulted in non-uniform downward migration \nFig. 10.Ca2+\/Cl- plot of groundwater samples including water type markers associated with salinization of freshwater aquifers.  \nFig. 11.Scheme of the past hydrogeological situations in CMP edited after Pham et al.

The data include  daily water demand for dwellings, business es, public \nservices, and industries . Water demand s range from 0.1 GPD per square foot of a retail store to \n150 GPD  per single family dwelling .

Had\nthe riverbeds within the VMD remained at their 2008 eleva-\ntions, the impact of SWI during the 2016 drought would have\nbeen signi\ufb01cantly lower. The deeper channels activate and\/or\nmagnify 3D subprocesses of upstream salt transport that can\nincreasingly amplify SWI. The VMD and many of its dis-\ntributaries occupy a wider area compared to e.g. the Hud-\nson River within the estuarine parameter space (Geyer and\nMacCready, 2013). Because of the spring\u2013neap variability\nand discharge sensitivity to external forces, the wide range of\nthe mixing parameter M(see Geyer and MacCready, 2013),\nranging between 0.6 and 2, shifts the VMD between areas\noccupied by the Hudson River and the Columbia and Conwy\nRiver. Unlike the Hudson River Estuary, where increased\nSWI could not be associated with gravitational circulation\n(Ralston and Geyer, 2019), here we quantify a clear increasein gravitational circulation and tidal straining, related to in-\ncreased strati\ufb01cation. This implies that perhaps gravitational\ncirculation and tidal straining tend to be more sensitive to\ndepth variation in systems with higher spring\u2013neap variabil-\nity compared to systems that tend to remain mixed or strati-\n\ufb01ed in time. As the main driver of increased SWI within the\nHam Luong channel (as well as others), approximately 10 km\nof additional SWI can be directly associated with riverbed\nlevel incision (Fig. 13). Although changes in SWI is often\nassociated with sea level rise and global climate change, this\ndetailed study of salinity in an Asian mega-delta emphasizes\nthe fact that riverbed level changes have been the key deter-\nminant of changes in SWI in the VMD (also see Eslami et al.,\n2019b).\n5 Conclusions\nThis study has provided a new understanding of the physi-\ncal processes that dominate SWI in the Mekong Delta. This\nwas done by carrying out \ufb01eld measurements and applying\na novel 2DV\u20133D numerical modelling of the entire Mekong\nDelta and a large part of its continental shelf (70 km offshore)\nthat could reproduce various observed salinity patterns.

To study the SWI along all the estuarine distributary\nchannels, Fig. 6 shows the modelled temporal variations of\nsubtidal depth-averaged SWI length (with 2 PSU threshold)\nalong seven distributary channels and the over-depth salinity\ndifference, indicating strati\ufb01cation. Overall, the VMD expe-\nriences a variable SWI of \u223c30\u201370 km during the dry season.\nDespite differences in magnitude, with the exception of the\nlower My Tho estuarine distributaries (Dai and Tieu), SWI\nfollows similar trends in the lower distributary channels ofthe Hau and Tien rivers. The estuarine systems of Tran De\u2013\nDinh An and Co Chien\u2013Cung Hau, as well as the Ham Luong\nchannel, show analogous temporal variations of SWI length.\nFurthermore, in terms of strati\ufb01cation, Co Chien\u2013Cung Hau\nand Tran De\u2013Dinh An show similar bi-weekly spring\u2013neap\nvariations; i.e. during the neap tide, Dinh An and Co Chien\n(the two deeper channels) experience a much higher strati\ufb01-\ncation than Tran De and Cung Hau. Between the lower dis-\ntributary channels of Cho Lach, strati\ufb01cation patterns of the\nsingle Ham Luong channel also resemble those of the deeper\nDinh An and Co Chien channels.\nHowever, within the lower My Tho channels, the narrower\nand shallower Dai and Tieu have more continuous SWI pat-\nterns.

In both channels, the Stokes\ntransport is always positive (upstream), and the residual Eu-\nlerian transport is always negative (downstream). The Dinh\nAn channel, because of its larger depth and cross-sectional\narea (nearly double in width), shows salt \ufb02uxes larger by\nnearly 2-fold. In both channels, the Stokes transport peaks\nby spring tide, driven by an increased amplitude of the semi-\ndiurnal tide and its associated mixing, while total salt trans-\nport is mainly downstream, driven by advective Eulerian\ntransport. Total salt \ufb02ux in the Dinh An channel can be char-\nacterized as more event-like compared to the Tran De chan-\nnel. This is especially driven by its spring\u2013neap variability in\nstrati\ufb01cation due to the larger depth of the Dinh An channel.\nIn both channels, estuarine circulation increases and domi-\nnates salt \ufb02ux with lower reduced mixing during neap tide.\nPrior to the two periods with maximum SWI (early Febru-\nary and March) upstream salt transport peaks, especially in\nthe Dinh An channel. These peaks start with peaks in es-\ntuarine circulation during neap tide and are sustained withpeaks in tidal straining at the onset of transition to the spring\ntide. While the terms associated with tidal pumping show\na limited contribution to the total salt \ufb02ux, tidal straining\nbecomes an important term during peak SWI events. Tidal\nstraining maximizes in transition between neap and spring,\nwhen semi-diurnal tidal amplitude increases, but the system\nis yet to transition from strati\ufb01ed to partially mixed. The as-\nsessment of salt \ufb02uxes further visualizes the importance of\nvarious forcings as well as geometry and bathymetry, i.e.\nchannel depth, in SWI. Therefore, by leveraging a similar\nanalysis, we will further investigate what salt transport mech-\nanisms are in\ufb02uenced when riverbed levels change within the\nestuarine system of the VMD.\n3.7 Effect of bathymetry\nThe calibrated model was run with the 2008 bathymetry to\ndemonstrate how bed level changes have in\ufb02uenced SWI in\nthe VMD.

Impacts of Flooding on Saltwater Intrusion  \n Flooding has been impacting groundwater quality over recent years because climate \nchange causes sea level rise and a higher intensity and frequency of severe storms. Coastal \nregions see high le vels of flooding specifically caused by storm surges and sea level rise, \nresulting in coastal surface water sources and aquifers facing issues in water quality. As coastal \nflooding occurs more frequently, an increased volume of saltwater is introduced into  coastal \naquifers and surface water sources (Mahmoodzadeh and Karamouz, 2017). Studies done on \npublic health issues after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita proved that storm surges \ncontaminated freshwater aquifers, and studies done in the northern Cook Islands  two years after \na category 5 cyclone showed atoll freshwater lenses (surface water sources) took between 11 to \n26 months to recover. An additional study showed that moderate storms impact groundwater \nflow and water transport in coastal systems. Thi s study showed that the occurrence of a tropical \nstorm 2000 m south of a Georgia salt marsh caused the marsh\u2019s creek water to move more than \n25 m from the creek bank at depths greater than 5 m (Mahmoodzadeh and Karamouz, 2017).  \n \n1.4.3 Impacts of Droughts o n Saltwater Intrusion  \nAs droughts occur worldwide with increased intensity and duration, the levels of \ngroundwater in aquifers in affected areas have decreased. This decrease in groundwater is caused \nby both a lack of rain during droughts and the removal of water from aquifers faster than it can \nbe recharged. During droughts, aquifers are recharged much slower because there is no rainwater  \nseeping into the ground and entering into aquifers (USGS, n.d. -h). Because of this issue, aquifers \nby the coast can be recharged with saltwat er during droughts.  \nThe occurrence of saltwater intrusion in aquifers has increased significantly in the U.S. \ndue to droughts occurring across the country. Saltwater intrusion caused by droughts has been an \nissue in California since 1946. In 1946, the firs t documented report of saltwater intrusion in the \nstate was sent out from a farming center in the Salinas Valley (Walton, 2019).

Along coastlines, saltwater and groundwater are separated \nby the seaward movement of groundwat er and a transition zone where freshwater and saltwater \nmix (Bradford, n.d.). When sea -levels rise and changes in precipitation levels occur, saltwater is \nlikely to enter the groundwater, reducing the availability of freshwater for coastal regions as a \nresult (Bradford, n.d.). This same impact occurs when too much water is extracted from aquifers, \nresulting in saltwater entering the groundwater as a means of recharging the aquifer (Huizer et \nal., 2018). If too much saltwater gets into the groundwater, the g roundwater\u2019s salt concentration \ncan become too high for human use and consumption (Bradford, n.d.).  \n1.4 Saltwater Intrusion  \nFreshwater naturally moves seaward, which prevents saltwater from moving into \nfreshwater aquifers.

Impacts of Flooding on Saltwater Intrusion  \n Flooding has been impacting groundwater quality over recent years because climate \nchange causes sea level rise and a higher intensity and frequency of severe storms. Coastal \nregions see high le vels of flooding specifically caused by storm surges and sea level rise, \nresulting in coastal surface water sources and aquifers facing issues in water quality. As coastal \nflooding occurs more frequently, an increased volume of saltwater is introduced into  coastal \naquifers and surface water sources (Mahmoodzadeh and Karamouz, 2017). Studies done on \npublic health issues after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita proved that storm surges \ncontaminated freshwater aquifers, and studies done in the northern Cook Islands  two years after \na category 5 cyclone showed atoll freshwater lenses (surface water sources) took between 11 to \n26 months to recover. An additional study showed that moderate storms impact groundwater \nflow and water transport in coastal systems. Thi s study showed that the occurrence of a tropical \nstorm 2000 m south of a Georgia salt marsh caused the marsh\u2019s creek water to move more than \n25 m from the creek bank at depths greater than 5 m (Mahmoodzadeh and Karamouz, 2017).  \n \n1.4.3 Impacts of Droughts o n Saltwater Intrusion  \nAs droughts occur worldwide with increased intensity and duration, the levels of \ngroundwater in aquifers in affected areas have decreased. This decrease in groundwater is caused \nby both a lack of rain during droughts and the removal of water from aquifers faster than it can \nbe recharged. During droughts, aquifers are recharged much slower because there is no rainwater  \nseeping into the ground and entering into aquifers (USGS, n.d. -h). Because of this issue, aquifers \nby the coast can be recharged with saltwat er during droughts.  \nThe occurrence of saltwater intrusion in aquifers has increased significantly in the U.S. \ndue to droughts occurring across the country. Saltwater intrusion caused by droughts has been an \nissue in California since 1946. In 1946, the firs t documented report of saltwater intrusion in the \nstate was sent out from a farming center in the Salinas Valley (Walton, 2019).

Along coastlines, saltwater and groundwater are separated \nby the seaward movement of groundwat er and a transition zone where freshwater and saltwater \nmix (Bradford, n.d.). When sea -levels rise and changes in precipitation levels occur, saltwater is \nlikely to enter the groundwater, reducing the availability of freshwater for coastal regions as a \nresult (Bradford, n.d.).

A news report on CBS Miami in 2021 provided evidence that saltwater i ntrusion \ncontributed to the condominium collapse at Champlain Towers South in Surfside, FL (DeFede, \n2021; CBSMiami.com Team, 2021). This resulted in 98 deaths (Lawson, 2021). This is an \nenvironmental issue as well as an engineering and policy issue.

Fresh gro undwater in areas along the Atlantic coast in general contains low levels (20 \nmg\/L) of salt that are a negligible source of daily salt intake, as daily salt intake is recommended \nto be less than 2,300 mg per day (Hedge, 2019; American Heart Association, n. d.). The World \nHealth Organization has set a guideline that drinking water must have less than 200 mg\/L of \nsodium in order for it to have a freshwater taste (MyTapWater.org, n.d.). Ground -water wells \nimpacted by saltwater intrusion contain elevated concent rations of salts and are sometimes \nunusable for this reason (Hedge, 2019). The severity of saltwater intrusion has accelerated in \nrecent years and has had adverse financial effects on treatment plants that rely on groundwater as \ntheir primary source of dri nking water (Hedge, 2019). As saltwater intrusion continues to \naccelerate, water treatment plants must be able to adapt their processes to accommodate changes \nin source water availability and quality. This may include the need to adjust the treatment \nproce sses themselves, such as adding a nanofiltration process or reverse -osmosis process, or find \na new source of water all together if water reaches salt levels above the limit of 200 mg\/L \n(USEPA, n.d. -b). \n \n1.4.7 Strategies for Managing Saltwater Intrusion  \nManagement of saltwater intrusion in an area poses many challenges ( Safi et al. , 2018 ). \nMonitoring an area is the first step to determine the extent of the problem.

Delft3D comprises a \nseries of modules to simulate flow, waves, water quality, \nmorphology, sediment transport and ecology. It has been \nsuccessfully implemented in the past for several applica -\ntions including the modelling of river deltas, freshwater \ndischarges in bays, stratified density flows and salt intru -\nsion problems (Hu et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2009 ; de Nijs and Pietrzak\u00a0 2012 ; \nElhakeem and Elshorbagy\u00a0 2013 ; Martyr-Koller et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2017 ). \nMore information on Delft3D can be found in its manual \n(Deltares 2013 ). The idealized delta derives from a 2D mor -\nphological simulation that precedes the simulations with \nsalinity. The setup of the morphological and salinity models \nis described in the following sections.\nMorphological Model Setup\nA structured rectangular grid is used that has dimensions \n20\u00a0km  \u00d7 22\u00a0km and it can be seen in F ig.\u00a0S1 of the \u2018Online \nResource\u2019. The grid resolution varies from 50 to 200\u00a0m in \nthe X direction and between 20 and 100\u00a0m in the Y direction \nof a Cartesian co-ordinate system. An inlet is added starting \nat the west boundary with 1.3\u00a0km length and 380\u00a0m width. \nThe resolution is finer close to the inlet and becomes coarser \noffshore and closer to the boundaries. The grid cell size for \nbuilding up an idealized delta is subject to certain limita -\ntions. Coarse resolution produces channels of constant width \nusually equal to one or two times the grid space step because \nadjacent cells transform abruptly from dry to wet. The result \nwould be a network with straight channels and no curvature \nor meandering. The resolution has to be as finer as possible \nso that the flow erodes the bed and the suspended sediments \nare deposited unevenly between adjacent cells forming \nchannels of various widths. For example, previous ideal -\nized delta studies done with Delft3D (e.g. Liu et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2020 ; \nBurpee et\u00a0al. 2015 ; Caldwell and Edmonds 2014 ; Edmonds \nand Slingerland 2010 ) all used a 625  m2 (25\u00a0m  \u00d7 25\u00a0m) grid \ncell area t hat is fit for the purpose. However, a very fine \nresolution requires a relatively small model area regarding \ncomputational efficiency. In simulations with salinity, larger \nmodel areas are needed to monitor the evolution of the off -\nshore buoyant plume both longitudinally and laterally.

Focusing on \nthe primary bio-physical aspects, the review has sections on: the Mekong \nRiver Delta and the central role of rice cropping, saline intrusion, \nalternative crops to rice, and in-field management practices to mitigate \nthe impacts of saline intrusion. \nThe Mekong River Delta (MRD) is in the south of Vietnam where the \nMekong River flows through a network of distributaries before reaching \nthe East Sea (Fig. 1). The Mekong is the longest river in Southeast Asia \nand originates in the Tibetan Plateau before flowing through China, \nMyanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam; it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R\u00a8as\u00a8anen et al., \n2017 ). Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ). The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ). Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction. Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ). Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ). With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).

In this study,\nwe used the SPI-based drought classi\ufb01cation for Vietnam, in which SPI = \u22120.25 signi\ufb01es\nthe onset of drought conditions [ 24]. Drought indicators were classi\ufb01ed into 10 hazard\nclasses of moisture and drought: very slight, slight, moderate, severe, and extreme drought.\nSPI was calculated for each period with the SPI thresholds, as shown in Equation (1), and\nSPI values for different drought conditions, as shown in Table 1.\nSPI i=(\nRi\u2212Ri)\n\u03c3i(1)\nwhere, Riis the total precipitation within the period, Riis the average precipitation in the\nperiod and, \u03c3iis the standard deviation.\nTable 1.

Does the model represent reality (scienti\ufb01c and con\ufb01dence-building validation)?\n2. Best \ufb01t to measured and calibrated hydraulic head (con\ufb01dence-building validation);\n3. Validate the groundwater balance (scienti\ufb01c validation);\n4. Validate hydrogeological parameters such as conductivity and porosity (scienti\ufb01c and\ncon\ufb01dence-building validation).\nAfter consideration of the availability, credibility, and distribution in each aquifer\/area\nof the Ca Mau peninsula, 46 monitoring wells were selected for validation. Groundwater\nmodel calibration is performed by systematically adapting the model parameters of con-\nductivity, speci\ufb01c storage, leakage factor, and porosity to the measured groundwater levels\nand the measured discharge in the river system to a plausible estimate of discharge at the\nhydraulic head boundaries and to a plausible groundwater balance. This results in the error\nvalue (positive or negative), which must be minimized during the process of calibration.\nThe calibration of the model is limited by three different conditions:\n1. Interpolation of unregistered extraction wells with an increase in annual growth\nof 2.5% from 2011 to 2019. Licensed exploitations were compared with the actual\nlicensed exploitation in 2018 from Ca Mau DONRE, in total by 65.7%, so in the model,\nthe corresponding increase was 6.5%\/year.\n2. Based on the data collected, the transient calibration phase is from January 2011 to\nDecember 2019.\n3. A reduced information base of groundwater monitoring data for the period January\n2011 to December 2019 (only three stations are available: Q199, Q188, and Q177). Since\nthe beginning of 2019, more groundwater measurement stations have been available\n(Figures 1 and 3).\n5.1. Model Validation of Hydraulic Head\nThe quality of the model is tested in space and time for different aquifers according to\nDavis and Goodrich\u2019s [31] second point mentioned at the beginning of this section.\nA usual model test in groundwater modeling can be performed using scatter data\nplots. These are shown for 46 monitoring wells for two different time steps in Figure 8.\nIn addition to this, the 1:1 line is shown. For January 2018 (dry period) and October\n2019 (rain period), values are shown for all the aquifers. The computed hydraulic head is\nconsistent with the measured data. The absolute error E, the root mean square (RMS), and\nthe standard deviation (sigma) values are very small; the correlation coef\ufb01cient is very high\nin both cases.\nAnother methodology for testing the model in space is the use of groundwater iso-\nhypses, which were used within the error between the measured and calculated hydraulic\nhead points for different well groups. A con\ufb01dential error of 1.5 m is chosen to verify the\nquality of model, taking into account the \ufb02uctuations of groundwater level during the day\nand the in\ufb02uence of tides. The difference due to these in\ufb02uences is about 1.5 m and can be\nup to 2.5 m [14].\nIn Figure 9, the simulated hydraulic heads from December 2019 for qp 1and n 22are\nshown.

Efforts to address the \nissue include the investment of structural (i.e., grey solutions) such as Ba Lai irrigation \nscheme and Kenh Lap reservoir.1 However, these have raised suspicions among scientist \nand local communities concerning how this conventional water management approach \nmight successfully deal with climatic events (e.g., extended drought) in the long term as \nwell as achieve sustainable agricultural development in the delta.\nData collection and analysis\nA multi-case study approach was adopted for this study (Yin, 2018 ). Qualitative research \nmethods were used to examine how \u2018grey\u2013green\u2019 solutions might be realized as an \ninnovative water management approach, using An Giang and Ben Tre as the two study \nsites. The analysis is supplemented with secondary data, which include policy documents, \njournal articles, and the recordings of national and regional conference events that \ndiscussed climatic events and water disruptions in the delta. The data include individual \nand group reflections from stakeholder workshops with provincial government officials \nand in-depth interviews with key informants, including provincial government officials, \nhydrological and agricultural experts, and farmers.Table 1.

However, this also reduces the salinity \nin the detached part of the plume (Fig.\u00a0 5e). The thickness of \nthis detached plume layer is higher in the macrotide scenario \n(Fig.\u00a0 5f) probably due to the higher tidal flow even though its \nlength at the surface is shorter.\nImpact of\u00a0Tides and\u00a0Bathymetry on\u00a0the\u00a0Salinity \nDistribution\nStream Labelling and\u00a0Bifurcation Methods\nImplementation of the Strahler\u2013Horton scheme in an ideal -\nized river-dominated delta (Matsoukis et\u00a0al. 2021 ) has pre -\nviously revealed a trend for salinity to increase as the SO \ndecreases. The existence of this trend in systems including \ntides was tested in this paper. The tide does not seem to \nmodify this relationship as the same trend between salinity \nand SO is observed in Fig.\u00a0 8c (macrotide case). Instead, the \nbathymetry was identified as a factor that influences and pre -\nvents this correlation. Because the number of orders presents \na symmetric distribution in the delta (Fig.\u00a0 7a), the salinity \ndoes not increase monotonically with the SO decrease when \nits spatial distribution is not symmetric. At these times, the \nwidth function scheme proved to be a useful alternative. In \nthis case, lateral instead of radial salinity averages lead to \na similar relationship with salinity decreasing as the width \nincreases. This is very convenient since the two methods \nappear to be complementary to each other. If the salinity \ndoes not decrease with a SO increase, it does decrease with \nthe width increase and vice versa. In addition, the WF seems \nto provide a trend with salinity when the river discharge is \nlow while the SO applies better at high flows.\nThe duration that each method (SO or WF) provides \na trend and the time of interchange between them might \nbe important to know because it can be indicative of the \nduration of low and high flow periods, the threshold val -\nues between them and the shape of the spatial salinity \ndistribution. Figure\u00a0 11 gives a timeline of the period and \nduration that each method provides a trend with salinity in \nthe five scenarios. The timeline shows that a salinity\u2013SO \nrelationship is present for the entire simulation period in \nthe mesotide case (TA  = 0.56\u00a0 m) while both SO and WF \nmethods provide a trend at all times in the macrotide case \n(TA = 1.1\u00a0m). A conclusion can be drawn here because \nit seems that high amplitude scenarios develop salinity \ndistributions that satisfy both methods independent of \nseasonal flow variations.

SWI \nis hazardous for many marine and vegetation species that \nhave limited tolerance to salinity. For instance, some types of phytoplankton, larvae fish and shrimps usually survive only in environments with less than 2\u00a0g\/kg salinity (Jassby et\u00a0al.\u00a0 1995; Hutton et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2016). Other vegetation species in \nthe Louisiana wetlands and Mississippi Delta (Sagittaria Latifolia, Sagittaria Lancifolia, phragmites australis) also require less than 2\u00a0g\/kg salinity (Visser et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2012; White \net\u00a0al.\u00a0 2019). In addition, high salinity may be responsible \nfor plant stress and mortality and hampering tree production (Kaplan et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2010; Bhuiyan and Dutta\u00a0 2012). Moreover, \nhuman health can be affected by salinization through water consumption. Drinking water should not contain more than 1\u00a0g\/kg salinity (de Vos\u00a0 1990; Dasgupta et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2015; Sherin \net\u00a0al.\u00a0 2020). Saline water environment is favourable for the \ndevelopment of microbes related to water borne diseases such as cholera or diarrhoea. Many cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh occurred after flooding because the water sup-ply was contaminated (Sarwar\u00a0 2005). Saline water has been \nalso reported as a leading cause for hypertension (Rahman et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2019). SWI causes currently similar problems to many \ndeltas worldwide, e.g. Mekong (Eslami et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2019), Yangtze \n(Chen et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2001; Dai et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2011; Qiu and Zhu\u00a0 2015), Pearl \nRiver (Liu et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2019; Hong et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2020), Nile (Frihy\u00a0 2003), \nMississippi (Day et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2005) and Bangladesh (Rahman\u00a0 2015; \nYang et\u00a0 al. 2015; Bricheno et\u00a0 al. 2016, 2021; Sherin \net\u00a0al.\u00a0 2020).\nSalt intrusion in estuaries is mainly determined by river \ndischarge, estuary shape, tidal and wave forcing (Nguyen et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2008; Dai et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2011; Gong and Shen\u00a0 2011; Maccready \net\u00a0al. 2018). Although the role of river discharge on the salin-\nity is usually dominant, this is low compared to the tidal flow during low flow periods when salt intrusion matters the most (Nguyen et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2008; Zhang et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2010). For example, the \nYangtze delta experiences saltwater intrusion during low flows and under strong tidal conditions affecting domestic water usage for millions of people in the city of Shanghai (Qiu and Zhu\u00a0 2015). The interaction of freshwater flow and \ntide establishes an estuarine circulation (or exchange flow) with seaward flow near the surface and landward flow near the bottom layer (Pritchard\u00a0 1956; Hansen and Rattray 1965; \nDyer 1973; MacCready and Geyer\u00a0 2010) although other cir -\nculation modes are possible too depending on the level of river and tidal forcing and variations in mixing (Geyer and MacCready\u00a0 2014). Landward salt transport is driven either by \nexchange flow or tidal dispersion (Banas et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2004; Lerczak \net\u00a0al.\u00a0 2006; MacCready\u00a0 2007; MacCready and Geyer\u00a0 2010). \nTidal processes determine the large-scale salt transport and distribution by influencing stratification and exchange flow (Liu et\u00a0al.\u00a0 2007; MacCready and Geyer\u00a0 2010). The exchange \nflow can be increased by tidal asymmetry especially during flood tides while strain-induced stratification might develop at the ebb tide (Simpson et\u00a0al.\u00a0 1990; Jay and Musiak\u00a0 1994; \nMacCready and Geyer\u00a0 2010).\nClimate change effects","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.8705251175}]},"Match":"YES"},{"Question":"How many desalination plants are currently located in the South Florida Water Management District?","Answer":{"metadata":{"85408121-258e-4296-aa53-27ebfb48da62":{"page_label":"72","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"},"ddfad08f-90b7-435c-8e9a-f8f34f32bd8e":{"page_label":"73","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"}},"response":"\n26","source_nodes":[{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":857,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"72","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"},"hash":"2dd5d642c8151949c66076c2cd00a9434ee7779261adc0c168b6d3f671c43acb","id_":"85408121-258e-4296-aa53-27ebfb48da62","metadata":{"page_label":"72","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":null,"node_id":"85408121-258e-4296-aa53-27ebfb48da62","node_info":{"start":0,"end":857},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":null,"ref_doc_id":"d0be7aa4-813c-41e4-9715-f747e01d0ede","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"669716313e0617cea677fc6968315a71e5e106c8e675db13495e261cda145f31","metadata":{"page_label":"72","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"},"node_id":"d0be7aa4-813c-41e4-9715-f747e01d0ede","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"669716313e0617cea677fc6968315a71e5e106c8e675db13495e261cda145f31","metadata":{"page_label":"72","file_name":"Water_and_Climate_Change.pdf"},"node_id":"d0be7aa4-813c-41e4-9715-f747e01d0ede","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":0,"text":"62 Florida\u2019s water management districts and includes 10 full counties and portions of 6 o ther \ncounties spanning from Orange County to Miami -Dade (South Florida Water Management \nDistrict, n.d.).

However, in recent years the saltwater wedge in the bottom of the aquifer has \nexpanded. In 1999, a monitoring  well was installed by the U.S. Geological Survey underneath \nthe Homestead -Miami Speedway in South Florida to measure the extent by which saltwater was \nmoving inland. By 2018, the measured chloride concentration at this well had increased tenfold, \nto about  12,000 milligrams per liter (for reference, the chloride concentration of seawater is \nabout 35,000 milligrams per liter). This is one example that the interface between saltwater and \nfreshwater is being drawn inland (Lambrecht, 2020). The goal of a desali nation plant would be to \nreduce the salinity to less than 200 mg\/L.  \nThe cost of using desalination to treat water for Dania Beach was estimated by \ncomparison to existing desalination plants in Florida and California. As discussed in Section 3.3, \nthe water treatment system in Dania Beach consists of two facilities: one that uses nanofiltration \nand reverse osmosis, and one that uses softening. The first system has a capacity of 5 MGD and a \nproduction of 2.2 MGD as of 2017 and includes a two stage nanofiltrati on membrane system and \na third and fourth stage of reverse osmosis. That system operates in conjunction with a 3 MGD \ncapacity lime softening system (Day, 2017). The treated water from both is then blended to \ncreate the final distributed product. Three trea tment plants with similar characteristics to the \ncurrent nanofiltration system in Dania Beach were evaluated: The Tampa Bay Plant, the Robert \nW. Goldsworthy Desalter, and the City of Cape Coral RO Water Treatment Facility. All three of \nthese treatment plan ts are desalination plants that use reverse osmosis (RO) as the primary \ntreatment method.  \nA summary of the Dania Beach treatment plant and the three comparison RO plants is \nprovided in Table 8. The seawater treatment plant in Tampa Bay, FL is the largest desalination \nplant in the U.S. and therefore demonstrates the cost of a plant which process es a higher volume \nthan the current plant in Dania Beach (Verdict Media Limited, 2022). This plant produces 25 \nMGD (Verdict Media Limited, 2022 & Tampa Bay Water, n.d.). The Robert W. Goldsworthy \nDesalter in Torrance, CA, while not located in Florida, has similar characteristics to the Dania \nBeach water treatment plant. This plant was expanded to increase its capacity of 2.5 MGD  to 5 \nMGD  (Scauzillo, 2018).

Increases of amplitude in river-dominated or \nlow tidal systems were found to offer several advantages. \nThe tide enhances the mixing in the delta and widens areas \nof brackish or freshwater. This flow enhancement is benefi -\ncial during the low flow periods because it helps to override \nbathymetric effects that produce asymmetric spatial salinity \ndistribution leaving large areas with very high salinity. Tidal \namplitude and river discharge increases lead progressively \nto more symmetric distributions. In addition, imposing \nmedium tidal amplitudes extends the time the delta remains \nfresh during the wet season. Tide-induced mixing increases \nthe freshwater volume in the delta compared to the river-\ndominated cases where the river discharge influence on the \nsalinity weakens in the most distant from the delta apex \nareas that remain either partially mixed or stratified dur -\ning the wet season. However, the freshwater is constrained \nin narrow areas around the inlet and its volume decreases \nsignificantly when the amplitude corresponds to meso- and \nmacrotide regimes. This results in the delta containing \nfreshwater for shorter time periods compared to the river-\ndominated and microtide cases. Tidal amplitude increases \nin such systems will deteriorate the conditions in terms of \nsalinization. In such cases, an amplitude decrease would be \nfavourable instead.\nAn offshore buoyant plume develops at flood tides with \nits vertical structure being determined by the tidal amplitude. \nLow amplitudes favour surface-advected and high-amplitude \nbottom-advected plumes. Surface-advected plumes may \nhave several consequences on the water quality offshore of \nthe delta counterbalancing the positive effects of tides inside \nthe delta in low and medium amplitude regimes.\nFinally, the role of bathymetry was found to be important \nbecause it affects the spatial salinity distribution. This has \nan impact on several salinity relations that were found to \nexist in a previous idealized study done for a case without \ntides. The salinity increases as the channels order decreases \nas long as its distribution remains symmetric and unaffected \nby bathymetry. In this case, the width function is suggested \nas an alternative where the salinity decreases as the width \nincreases. The stream order method was successful at times \nof high and the width function at times of low flows. Asym -\nmetric distributions do affect also the exponential correlation \nbetween radial salinity averages and river discharge. As long \nas the spatial salinity distribution is not symmetric, the two \nmagnitudes are correlated by a double exponential equation \nthat shows similarities with the solution of the 1D advec -\ntion\u2013diffusion equation in the presence of a wall boundary \npreventing the flow behind of it. Therefore, it is inferred \nthat the methods are not affected by tidal forcing but can be \nsensitive to bathymetric differences.Supplementary Information  The online version cont ains supplemen -\ntary material available at https:\/\/  doi. org\/ 10. 1007\/  s12237-  022- 01109-2 .\nFunding  The wor k contained in this paper contains work conducted \nduring a PhD study supported by the Natural Environment Research \nCouncil (NERC) EAO Doctoral Training Partnership whose support \nis gratefully acknowledged.

For example, when the river discharge is low (dry season), the riverine flow may not be able to transfer freshwater in long distances leaving the downstream parts of the delta with high salinity. Tide-induced mixing though can decrease the salinity in these outer areas. This is the reason why the FWV is higher in the tidal cases at the times of the minimum water level (LW) compared to the river-dominated cases (Fig.\u00a0 6b). However, these positive effects may reverse \nif the TA increases too much and starts decreasing the FWV (Fig.\u00a0 6a). Results indicated that low tide systems may ben-\nefit by a TA increase while high tide\u2013dominated systems will not. In the latter case, a decrease of the TA due to SLR could be beneficial for such systems. Within the context of this manuscript, the microtide case (scenario 3, TA\n = 0.15\u00a0m\n \nand flow\/tide ratio equal to 0.073) represents the bound-ary between river-dominated and tidally influenced cases. The TA increase from 0\u00a0m to 0.15\u00a0m results in wider low salinity areas (Tables\u00a0 2 and\u00a0 3) and leads to more symmetric \nspatial salinity distribution (Figs.\u00a0 2 and\u00a0 3). Therefore, the \nmicrotide case provides wider areas of low salinity (<\n 5\u00a0g\/\nk\ng) and freshwater (<  2\u00a0g\/k\ng) and keeps the delta fresh for \nthe longest period (Fig.\u00a0 9). In contrast, further increase of \nthe TA resulted in a significant reduction of the low salinity areas, freshwater periods and volumes in the delta.\nTidal motion imposes several mechanisms on buoyant \ninflow. Garvine (1999) identifies enhanced vertical (tidal) mixing, tidal straining and subtidal flow nonlinearities as some of them. These may be the cause behind the differences in the spatial salinity distribution due to TA variations. At low flow times (panels a, c, e, g, i in Figs.\u00a0 2 and\u00a0 3), freshwater flow is \ndirected to the right of the delta apex decreasing the salinity but leaving almost unaffected the areas left of it. The TA increase leads to more symmetric shapes (compare between panels a, c, e and g, i in Figs.\u00a0 2 and 3 ). Such a tidal effect has been observed \non buoyant plumes deflected to the right under the influence of the Coriolis force (in the northern hemisphere) or in the presence of ambient crossflows (Chao and Boicourt\u00a0 1986; \nChao\u00a0 1988; O\u2019Donnell\u00a0 1990; Oye\u00a0 1992; Kourafalou et\u00a0al.\u00a0 1996; \nNarayanan and Garvine\u00a0 2002; Lee and Valle-Levinson\u00a0 2013; \nCole and Hetland\u00a0 2016). Since none of these parameters is \nincluded in these simulations the asymmetry in the present case can only be ascribed to the bathymetry (see \u2018Initial Con-ditions \u2019). Many plume studies argued on the effect of high tidal \nforcing that diminishes such deflections. Chao (1990) has stated that the tidal residual circulation enhances the plume growth and limits the coastal jet. Garvine (1999) noticed that tidal forc-ing restricts the plume advection in the across-shelf direction decreasing significantly the upshelf and downshelf penetration. This tidal effect towards more symmetric plumes is a common conclusion in a number of other papers concerning buoyant plume structures under tidal influence (Chao\u00a0 1990; Isobe\u00a0 2005; \nGuo and Valle-Levinson\u00a0 2007; Lee and Valle-Levinson\u00a0 2013).\nAt high flow times (panels b, d, f, h, j in Figs.\u00a0 2 and\u00a0 3),","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.9004913712}]},"Match":"YES"},{"Question":"What is the main environmental problem faced by the coastal provinces of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?","Answer":{"metadata":{"25f1e580-d373-4818-8238-f704e11ba8d6":{"page_label":"20","file_name":"SSRN-id4499863.pdf"},"f9945acc-8b11-4885-954f-ff8168844c32":{"page_label":"22","file_name":"SSRN-id4499863.pdf"}},"response":"\nThe main environmental problem faced by the coastal provinces of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam is drought and saltwater intrusion.","source_nodes":[{"node":{"child_nodes":null,"embedding":null,"end_char_idx":2698,"excluded_embed_metadata_keys":[],"excluded_llm_metadata_keys":[],"extra_info":{"page_label":"20","file_name":"SSRN-id4499863.pdf"},"hash":"4eabda3d5251d680d472b729c3a02d0894ce71bf574571c38157426c2a6616c4","id_":"25f1e580-d373-4818-8238-f704e11ba8d6","metadata":{"page_label":"20","file_name":"SSRN-id4499863.pdf"},"metadata_seperator":"\n","metadata_template":"{key}: {value}","next_node":{"hash":"6f9f55474b2b67798d0bf6a8fb4a29459d7ef6803a312e644c8cf660f61d56bc","metadata":{"page_label":"20","file_name":"SSRN-id4499863.pdf"},"node_id":"b3462c0e-cb98-4ac6-8973-70060555ed17","node_type":null},"node_id":"25f1e580-d373-4818-8238-f704e11ba8d6","node_info":{"start":0,"end":2698},"parent_node":null,"prev_node":null,"ref_doc_id":"87e66f88-7f58-4728-921c-ccc0fd617c57","relationships":{"1":{"hash":"55d09d21804e4f9bd2d3bce5099403804c2c0769e5632097010e0df7ad64af9b","metadata":{"page_label":"20","file_name":"SSRN-id4499863.pdf"},"node_id":"87e66f88-7f58-4728-921c-ccc0fd617c57","node_type":null},"3":{"hash":"6f9f55474b2b67798d0bf6a8fb4a29459d7ef6803a312e644c8cf660f61d56bc","metadata":{"page_label":"20","file_name":"SSRN-id4499863.pdf"},"node_id":"b3462c0e-cb98-4ac6-8973-70060555ed17","node_type":null}},"source_node":{"hash":"55d09d21804e4f9bd2d3bce5099403804c2c0769e5632097010e0df7ad64af9b","metadata":{"page_label":"20","file_name":"SSRN-id4499863.pdf"},"node_id":"87e66f88-7f58-4728-921c-ccc0fd617c57","node_type":null},"start_char_idx":0,"text":"20510Mekong Delta coastal zone of Vietnam, Environ.

A further study demon-\nstrated that a 1-D hydraulic analysis model (that is the Hydrologic Engineering Center\u2019s\nRiver Analysis System (HEC-RAS)) can provide informative estimates of water quality\nresponses to sea level rise scenarios for Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam [ 44]. The advantage\nof HEC-RAS is that it is free software, requires simple data input, exhibits an easy-to-use\ninterface [ 45,46], and can simulate salinity using the module of water quality analysis [ 47].\nOther models applied HEC-RAS to tidal wave propagation and numerically modeled\nsalinity transport [ 48]. The 1-D hydraulic mathematical model is reliable in that a salinity\nvariation over time is performed at a speci\ufb01c location, but it requires more data and time to\nperform [ 38,48]. The modeling tool is therefore useful for water managers and engineers\nto make rough estimates of saline intrusion along the estuary axis even during extreme\nevents. Previous studies have developed hydraulic and salinity models in HEC-RAS to\nevaluate the variables that govern both the \ufb02ow and salinity within a river system with\nhighly reliable data [ 36,49].

Hydraulic Simulation\nThe dispersion of salinity is in\ufb02uenced by the hydraulic regime and highly dependent\non estuary morphology. In the hydraulic module, HEC-RAS solves the following 1-D\ncontinuity and momentum equations, known as the Saint-Venant equations [21,50\u201353].\n\u2202A\n\u2202t+\u2202(Au)\n\u2202x=0 (1)\n\u2202u\n\u2202t+u\u00b7\u2202u\n\u2202x+g\u00b7\u2202\u03b5\n\u2202x=\u2212(P\nA)\n\u00b7(\u03c4\n\u03c1)\n(2)\nwhere xis river length (m); tis time (s); Ais wet cross-section area (m2);uis \ufb02ow velocity\n(m\/s); \u03b5is water level (m); \u03c4is shear stress of water; Pis wet cross-section perimeter (m);\n\u03c1is the speci\ufb01c weight of water (kg\/m3); and gis gravity acceleration (m\/s2).

Salinity Simulation\nThe water quality analysis module of the HEC-RAS model system was used to simulate\nsalinity. The salinity boundary conditions were observed hourly salinity at coastal monitor-\ning stations on the Tien River, Ham Luong River, Co Chien River, and Hau River. In order to\nsimulate the salinity propagation, salinity dispersion coef\ufb01cients were required [ 36,54,55].\nIn the VMD, the dispersion coef\ufb01cients of salinity were determined to be 500 m2\/s at Can\nTho and My Thuan, and gradually increased at the estuaries (approximately 7500 m2\/s)\nfound through calibration and validation methods.\n2.4. Model Calibration and Validation\nThe most recent year (2020) was selected for the baseline scenario to compare with\n2050; therefore, the water level and salinity data were calibrated for 2020 and then validated\nfor another year (2015). For hydraulic calibration and validation, Manning\u2019s ncoef\ufb01cients\n(the riverbed roughness) (Equation (3)) were adjusted so that the simulated and observed\nwater levels are approximately the same [ 22]. The Nash\u2013Sutcliffe ef\ufb01ciency (NSE) (Equation\n(4)) was used to test the reliability of the hydraulic models [ 13,42,56,57]. NSE of the Tra\nVinh and Cau Quan stations (Figure 1b) were calculated based on the comparison of\nobserved and simulated water levels for the years 2020 and 2015, respectively, to calibrate\nand validate the hydraulic model. For salinity calibration and validation, the NSE and\ncorrelation coef\ufb01cients (R2) of 6 stations (Figure 1b) were used to calibrate and validate\nthe salinity [ 42,58] by adjusting the dispersion coef\ufb01cients of each river section so that\nthe measured and simulated salinity values were equivalent. R2was calculated using the\nCORREL function for observed and simulated salinity values in Microsoft Excel software.\nNSE and R2close to 1 showed a high-reliability model [59].\nNSE =1\u2212n\n\u2211\nt=1(Sim t\u2212Obs t)2\/n\n\u2211\nt=1(\nObs t\u2212Obs)2\n(4)\nwhere tis time;","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.8621557005}]},"Match":"YES"},{"Question":"Why does an earth canal require more maintenance and rehabilitation compared to the other canals?","Answer":{"metadata":{"93096d0c-5301-4787-a81f-a81968166ed8":{"page_label":"90","file_name":"IrrigationGuidance.pdf"},"8db49f81-1ae6-4c68-a12b-55b9f7ae908a":{"page_label":"91","file_name":"IrrigationGuidance.pdf"}},"response":"\nAn earth canal requires more maintenance and rehabilitation compared to the other canals because it is more vulnerable to flood and erosion, and has a lower durability than the other canals.

At Phnom Penh, the capital city, there are four branches creating a complex hydraulic system: the Upper Mekong, the Lower Mekong, the Bassac, and the Tonle Sap River connecting the Tonle Sap Great Lake. Differences between water levels in the Tonle Sap Lake and the water levels in the mainstream Mekong cause the flow reversal from the Mekong to Tonle Sap Lake (MRC, 2020).","text_template":"{metadata_str}\n\n{content}"},"score":0.8407895552}]},"Match":"NO"}]
