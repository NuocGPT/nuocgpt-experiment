The data collected is then used to create spatial distribution maps of groundwater salinity to delineate the interfaces of fresh\/salt water in the aquifers. A number of monitoring wells are then assigned along the interfaces to observe the changes of TDS concentration monthly. The data collected is then used to construct numerical groundwater models to enhance understanding of the conceptual model and provide a first estimate of spatial-temporal variations of groundwater levels (GWLs) and salinity distribution. The models are then calibrated using the trial-and-error method to obtain the best fit to observed GWL fluctuations and TDS concentrations.

These solutions are believed to be highly effective due to their immediate response to acute risks, but they have several drawbacks. They can alter coastal morphology, leading to changes in ecosystems, and they are often expensive. In contrast, 'grey green' solutions prioritize green infrastructure and ecological systems to help sustain society and build resilience. These solutions are seen as a complement to grey solutions, and they are believed to have the potential to address multiple water challenges, mitigate rainfall and drought extremes, and support adaptation in times of altered social-ecological relationships.",

Local downwards migration of shallow saline water, on the other hand, is the result of high groundwater exploitation rates and high hydraulic connectivity within and across aquifers, which leads to the release of divalent cations in Pleistocene aquifers.",

Increases of amplitude in river-dominated or low tidal systems can offer several advantages, such as enhancing the mixing in the delta and widening areas of brackish or freshwater. This flow enhancement is beneficial during the low flow periods because it helps to override bathymetric effects that produce asymmetric spatial salinity distribution, leaving large areas with very high salinity. However, in high tide-dominated systems, an increase in tidal amplitude can lead to a decrease in the low salinity areas, freshwater periods and volumes in the delta. Tidal motion can also impose several mechanisms on buoyant inflow, such as enhanced vertical (tidal) mixing, tidal straining and subtidal flow nonlinearities, which can affect the spatial salinity distribution.",
