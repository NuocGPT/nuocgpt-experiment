        "Question":"What is the significance of water as a first-hand input to agricultural production?",
        "Answer":"\nWater is a critical first-hand input to agricultural production, as it is essential for plant growth and development. Without adequate water, plants cannot photosynthesize and produce biomass, leading to decreased yields. Additionally, water can be used to irrigate crops, which can help to offset the effects of infrequent rainfall events and reduce the dependence on irrigation water. Water can also be used to reduce the effects of salinity on crop yields, as salt-tolerant crops can be grown with less irrigation water. Finally, water can be used to improve the water use efficiency of crops, allowing them to produce more biomass or grain per unit of water.",

Unplanned irrigation can lead to water being delivered to some farmlands more than necessary while less water is distributed to others. Low quality construction can lead to cracks on concrete structures, uneven bottoms of canals, and soil erosion in construction sites. Low drainage capacity can lead to flood water overflowing from drainage canals and reservoirs and staying in farmlands for a long period.

Furthermore, policies were issued in a timely manner to implement solutions to respond to drought and saline intrusion and support local people. The irrigation system in 2020 was also notably superior to that of 2015-2016, positively impacting responses to drought and saline intrusion. Additionally, sowing dates were shifted up 10 to 20 days earlier than in previous years to avoid the high risk of drought and saline intrusion, and all resources were devoted to protecting existing areas, rather than planting new trees and crops.

Simultaneously, overall salinity increases, while also the proportion of divalent cations increases. Conversely, during freshening, freshwater of Ca-HCO3 type intrudes the saline aquifer, exchanging Na+ on mineral surfaces with Ca2+ and Mg2+, and the water type changes to the characteristic Na-HCO3.

Farmers need to provide information on water sources, such as water levels in a river or a reservoir and water flow in canals, for rational judgments. Local governments need to advise farmers and supervise the Water User Association (WUA) management. Dialogue between farmers and local governments should be rationally proceeded in line with the principle of equality. For intersectoral issues such as droughts, water quality, and other environmental degradation, WUAs, governments, and other interest groups need to discuss solutions and take action by creating water management councils composed of them. Farmers also need to participate in the management of irrigation facilities and pay water charges to the WUAs.

        "Question":"What is saline intrusion and how does it affect coastal estuarine deltas?",
        "Answer":"\nSaline intrusion is the process of saltwater entering freshwater systems, such as coastal estuarine deltas. This process can have a significant impact on the environment, as it can reduce the amount of freshwater available for agricultural production, lead to soil salinization, and disrupt the local ecology. In addition, it can also have a negative impact on the livelihoods of local farmers, as it can reduce their access to freshwater and lead to crop\/production diversification.",
