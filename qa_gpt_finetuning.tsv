Question	Answer	Context
What are the major threats to agriculture in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam due to climate change, and what are the most common agricultural adaptation strategies used to cope with these threats?	Climate change poses significant threats to agriculture in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. One of the primary concerns is salinity intrusion, which can create unsuitable conditions for rice production. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. Groundwater recharge is also expected to be substantially altered due to climate change, with high reductions during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise, which can further exacerbate salinity intrusion, are ranging between 14-31 cm. In terms of adaptation strategies, the context does not provide specific methods used in the Mekong Delta. However, it mentions that climate change, sea level rise, and salt intrusion are complex and multifaceted problems, implying that there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation. Instead, a variety of strategies are likely employed to address the problem on different scales.

What were the impacts of the 2015/2016 El Niño event on rice production and water availability in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam, particularly in relation to salinity levels and saltwater intrusion?	The 2015/2016 El Niño event had severe impacts on rice production and water availability in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam. This event was classified as one of the most severe droughts in the past 90 years in south Vietnam, leading to a decline in water discharge in the upstream part of the Mekong River Delta. At the same time, salinity levels in the lower part of the deltas increased due to saltwater intrusion. Salinity levels of more than 4 g/L were found in the river water up to 90 km from the coast. This resulted in adverse effects on eleven out of thirteen provinces and around 225,000 ha of rice land in the Mekong River Delta, leading to high economic losses.

Nguyen & Anh, 2015; Wassmann, Hien, Hoanh, & Tuong, 2004; Wassmann et al., 2009).The severe effects of sea water intrusion are pronounced es -\npecially during extreme weather events, such as El Niño, the warm phase of the climate phenomena El Niño -Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Chen, McCarl, & Chang, 2008).During this phase, which mainly occurs during the dry season, rainfall is below average with increased average temperature (FAO, 2016a) and as stated in the fifth assessment report of IPCC, these pronounced weather ex -\ntremes will likely intensify (Christensen et al., 2013).Historical events have demonstrated the massive impact of El Niño on rice production and food security.The FAO has classified Vietnam and Myanmar as vulnerable regions to impacts of El-Niño (FAO, 2016a).The El Niño of 2015/2016 severely affected agricultural produc -\ntion in the Mekong River Delta and Ayeyarwady Delta.According to the (FAO, 2016b), this event was classified as one of the most severe droughts in the past 90 years in south Vietnam, leading to \ndeclined water discharge in the upstream part of the Mekong River Delta, while salinity levels in the lower part of the deltas increased due to saltwater intrusion (CGIAR, 2016).Salinity levels of more than 4 g/L have been found in the river water up to 90 km distance from the coast (FAO, 2016b).Eleven out of thirteen provinces and around 225,000 ha of rice land in the Mekong River Delta were adversely affected, resulting in high economic losses (CGIAR, 2016).Also in Myanmar, the El Niño of 2015/16 severely affected water \navailability and agricultural production: Reduced rainfall in early 2015 led to a water shortage lasting until the mid of the subsequent year (Sutton, Srivastava, Rosegrant, Thurlow, & Vasileiou, 2019).The Ayeyarwady Delta was one of the countries most affected regions suffering water scarcity and lowered groundwater levels (Taft & Evers,  2016).TABLE 1\u2003Overview and characteristics of mega deltas in Asia\nDelta CountryDelta area (in \n1,000 km2)Average annual river discharge (maximum/ minimum) in m3/sec Tidal influence Average annual rainfall (in mm) Climate (AEZ) Main Agricultural Product Main challengesVulnerability due to sea-level rise\na\u200a\nTigris-Euphrates Iraq 880 1,966 (3,299/849) ✓ 900 Arid Wheat, Barley, Rice Water availability Medium\nIndus Pakistan 1,120 2,644 (10,128/189) ✓ 200 Arid to semi-arid Wheat, Rice, Sugarcane, Cotton Water availability, Saltwater \nintrusionMedium\nGodavari India 127 3,079 (11,567/122) ✓ 1,100 Sub humid to \nsemi-aridSugarcane, Cotton, Rice Water management, Deforestation High\nGanges–Brahmaputra Bangladesh 106 29,692 (80,984/6,041)-1,500 Tropical monsoon \nclimateRice, Aquaculture Urbanization, Salinity, Water \nManagementExtreme\nAyeryawady (Irrawaddy) Myanmar 21 12,564 (36,000/n.s.)']
"""What are the main crops grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and what are the potential challenges related to water management and saltwater intrusion according to the context provided?"""	The main crop grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam is rice, with an annual production of 25 million tons on 4.25 million hectares. This area contributes to over 50% of the national rice export. However, there are significant challenges related to water management and saltwater intrusion. The hydrological infrastructure of the Mekong River Delta has been greatly altered by human activity, and the region is at risk due to changes in groundwater recharge and rising salinity levels. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which is unsuitable for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta could be at high risk. Climate change is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise are ranging between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater. Under this scenario, around 30,000 hectares of rice land could be jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

It is a tropical monsoon climate with a distinct rainy season during June-November and over 80% of the precipitation occurs during the rainy season and resulting frequently in seasonal floods (MARD, 2016) (Figure 2).\nAlluvial soils, , which account for 30% of the total area in the \nMekong river delta, provide the environment for a fruitful rice pro -\nduction (GRiSP, 2013). Although the total land area of the delta ac -\ncounts for only 12% of the total area of the country, it has significant importance for the national economy, and in particular for national agriculture (MARD, 2016). The rural population is highly dependend on agriculture in the delta, as 75% of the population is employed in the agricultural sector (GRiSP, 2013; Thanh, 2016).\nThe most important crop is rice, of which 25 million tons are pro -\nduced annually on 4.25 million ha (harvested area) (Vo et al., 2018).

What are the main threats to food security in the Mekong River delta in Vietnam, particularly in relation to salinity and water management?	The main threats to food security in the Mekong River Delta, particularly in relation to salinity and water management, include salinity intrusion and changes in groundwater levels. Salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m pose unsuitable conditions for rice production, putting about 40% of the total rice harvest at high risk. Groundwater levels and their salt concentration vary depending on the season and distance to the coast. Climate change is projected to significantly alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons.

What are the main crops grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and what are the major challenges related to water management and salinity intrusion according to the context provided?	The main crop grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam is rice, with an annual production of 25 million tons on 4.25 million hectares. This region contributes to over 50% of the national rice export. However, the Mekong Delta faces significant challenges related to water management and salinity intrusion. Salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m pose unsuitable conditions for rice production, putting about 40% of the total rice harvest at high risk. Groundwater, an important source for municipal and industrial water demands, is expected to undergo substantial changes due to climate change, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland and increase salinity in freshwater. This could jeopardize around 30,000 hectares of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

How does the seasonal change in the Mekong River's flow rates contribute to saltwater intrusion and water scarcity in the Mekong Delta?	During the dry season, tidal fluctuations push saline intrusion 40–80 km towards the inland in the Mekong River Delta, reducing water quality. This salinity intrusion poses a persistent threat to agricultural production. Additionally, climate change is expected to significantly alter groundwater recharge in the area, with a high reduction during dry seasons. This could exacerbate water scarcity issues. Furthermore, projections for sea level rise indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, which could increase salinity in freshwater and jeopardize rice land.

Minar, Hossain, & Shamsuddin, 2013).Assuming an average yield of 4.3 t/ha,\n1 salinity in this particular area jeopardizes 3.4 million tons of rice \nor 7% of the national rice production.According to the Soil Science Development Institute (SRDI) of Bangladesh, reported in Rabbani, Munira, and Saif (2018), over 50% of the agricultural land of \nBangladesh is degraded by saline water.In addition, the rate of salt -\nwater intrusion is increasing with an average increase of 0.74% and a total expansion by 1.06 million ha from 1973 to 2009 (SRDI (2010) in Jabed, Paul, and Nath, (2018)).As a consequence of uncontrolled groundwater abstraction \nand overexploitation, water pollution including saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, lowering of groundwater table depths, decreased flows of rivers during the dry season and possible land subsidence was described (FAO, 2011).High relative sea level rise was reported for coastal areas in \nthe Ganges–Brahmaputra delta as over 20 mm per year (Ericson, \nVörösmarty, Dingman, Ward, & Meybeck,  2006).Similar findings \nwere reported by Singh et al.2000, reported in Baten, Seal, and Lisa (2015)), stating a relative sea level rise of 4.0–7.8 mm/year in three different locations in coastal Bangladesh.Dasgupta et al.(2014) investigated current and future river salin -\nity for the southwest region of Bangladesh, using different emission and relative sea level rise scenarios (RMSL) (Table 3).Even under the best-case scenario (B1 and 35 cm RMSL), the \nresults indicate that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh by 2050.The authors further estimated a decrease by 11.1% and 29.7% of area suitable for agriculture in the best case and worst-case (A2 and 67 cm RMSL) scenario, respectively.3.2\u2003|\u2003Mekong River Delta\nLow annual floods during rainy season inundate up to 35% of the area (Tuan et al., ;

Taft & Evers, 2016).Rising sea level increase soil salinity levels and consequently lead to a loss of arable land in the coastal area (Seinn Seinn, Ahman, Thapa, & Shresta, 2015).As summarized by Oo, Huylenbroeck, and Speelman (2018), salt intrusion poses a year-round threat on coastal areas of Myanmar and thus, is classified as a major threat for agriculture.As development of water dams and hydropower upstream of the \ndelta continues, the amount of sediments reaching the delta will de -\ncrease and erosion will accelerate in coastal land at the river mouth.Currently, no hydropower dams are installed yet at the Ayeyarwady River, but many are in the planning stage (Taft & Evers, 2016).So far, scientific and peer-reviewed research on impacts of an -\nthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations on the water resources in Ayeyarwady delta are lacking, but are extremely ur -\ngent for planning future water allocation and management (Taft & Evers,  2016).4\u2003| \u2003ADAPTATION OPTIONS\nIt is widely recognized that climate change poses a threat to both, people and environment at different levels.In AMDs, the impacts of global change pose a threat to agricultural production, food security, livelihood and national economies.However, climate change, and also sea level rise and salt intrusion are complex and multifaceted problems.Therefore, there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation possible, but there are many ways to address the problem on different scales.']
What is the impact of salinity intrusion on rice production in delta areas and how does it relate to sea level rise due to global warming?	Salinity intrusion, which is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers, can have significant impacts on rice production in delta areas. This is particularly problematic in areas such as the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and the Mekong River Delta. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, salinity intrusion affects nearly 0.8 million hectares or 53% of the total area, jeopardizing 3.4 million tons of rice or 7% of the national rice production. In the Mekong River Delta, if salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, or about 40% of the total rice harvest, are at high risk.Sea level rise due to global warming is a key factor accelerating this salinity intrusion. Rising sea levels can push saline water further inland, increasing the salinity of both ground and surface water. This reduces the amount of available freshwater for irrigation, which is crucial for rice production. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the rate of saltwater intrusion is increasing with an average increase of 0.74% and a total expansion by 1.06 million hectares from 1973 to 2009. In the Mekong River Delta, projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland, jeopardizing around 30,000 hectares of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes.

What factors are associated with the extent of salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta and how does it affect agricultural production during the dry season?	The extent of salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta is associated with factors such as rainfall, upstream water discharge, and tidal pressure. During the dry season, salinity poses a persistent threat to agricultural production. Tidal fluctuations push saline intrusion 40–80 km towards inland, reducing water quality. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, conditions become unsuitable for rice production, putting about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, or about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta, at high risk. Climate change is also expected to significantly alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise, which can further exacerbate salinity intrusion, range between 14-31 cm. Under certain scenarios, around 30,000 ha of rice land are jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes.

The context information does not provide a specific percentage or area of agricultural land in the Mekong Delta that has been affected by varying degrees of salinity. However, it does mention that about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, or about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta, are at high risk due to salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m. Additionally, under a certain scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land are jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes due to increased salinity.

Kundzewicz et al., 2007).In the following, threats specifically referring to the individual \ndeltas are described:\n3.1\u2003 |\u2003Ganges –Brahmaputra Delta\nThe delta plain of the Ganges–Brahmaputra is prone to floods and according to the (FAO, 2011), “each year about 18 percent of Bangladesh is inundated during the monsoon season.” In a study, Mirza, Warrick, and Ericksen (2003) estimated the average area under flooding as 30% with a maximum of 70% during extreme floods.During the dry season, water scarcity and salinity are major con -\ncerns to agriculture.A reduced freshwater flow enables sea water, pushed by strong tidal forces, to intrude up to 200 km towards the inland (Dasgupta et al., 2014).With the onset of the pre-monsoon (late April), salinity levels in river decrease and finally drop with the onset of the monsoon end of May.Coastal areas are particularly at risk, with nearly 0.8 million ha or \n53% of the total area being affected by salinity (FAO, 2002; Minar, Hossain, & Shamsuddin, 2013).Assuming an average yield of 4.3 t/ha,\n1 salinity in this particular area jeopardizes 3.4 million tons of rice \nor 7% of the national rice production.According to the Soil Science Development Institute (SRDI) of Bangladesh, reported in Rabbani, Munira, and Saif (2018), over 50% of the agricultural land of \nBangladesh is degraded by saline water.In addition, the rate of salt -\nwater intrusion is increasing with an average increase of 0.74% and a total expansion by 1.06 million ha from 1973 to 2009 (SRDI (2010) in Jabed, Paul, and Nath, (2018)).As a consequence of uncontrolled groundwater abstraction \nand overexploitation, water pollution including saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, lowering of groundwater table depths, decreased flows of rivers during the dry season and possible land subsidence was described (FAO, 2011).High relative sea level rise was reported for coastal areas in \nthe Ganges–Brahmaputra delta as over 20 mm per year (Ericson, \nVörösmarty, Dingman, Ward, & Meybeck,  2006).Similar findings \nwere reported by Singh et al.2000, reported in Baten, Seal, and Lisa (2015)), stating a relative sea level rise of 4.0–7.8 mm/year in three different locations in coastal Bangladesh.Dasgupta et al.(2014) investigated current and future river salin -\nity for the southwest region of Bangladesh, using different emission and relative sea level rise scenarios (RMSL) (Table 3).Even under the best-case scenario (B1 and 35 cm RMSL), the \nresults indicate that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh by 2050.The authors further estimated a decrease by 11.1% and 29.7% of area suitable for agriculture in the best case and worst-case (A2 and 67 cm RMSL) scenario, respectively.3.2\u2003|\u2003Mekong River Delta\nLow annual floods during rainy season inundate up to 35% of the area (Tuan et al., ;

Based on the provided context, how is the salinity level in the rivers of the Mekong Delta expected to change by 2050 due to climate change?	The salinity level in the rivers of the Mekong Delta is expected to increase due to climate change. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, and under the RCP 6.0 emission scenario, the rise is simulated as 25-30cm. This would cause a shift of the brackish water front further inland, about 50-60 km. Locations close to the coast (15-20 km away) are estimated to see an increase in salinity in freshwater by 0.5–2.5 g/L, and locations 30 km away are estimated to have an increase of 1–1.5 g/L. This scenario could put around 30,000 ha of rice land at risk, with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes.

What are some of the adaptation options for rice farming in areas affected by changing environments and salinity intrusion, according to the report?	Some of the adaptation options for rice farming in areas affected by changing environments and salinity intrusion include the selection of appropriate rice varieties for the specific environment. For example, replacing salinity-sensitive rice varieties with salinity-tolerant ones can help maintain rice production in areas with soil salinity levels up to 3‰. Further research and breeding for salt- and drought-tolerant varieties with improved yields is also important. Despite lower yields, the implementation and dissemination of less susceptible rice varieties should not be excluded in salinity adaptation plans. Other adaptation options on the farm level include a shift to climate- and environment-adapted cropping cycles with adapted varieties. For example, farmers can adapt to altered rainfall conditions by using cultivars with a shorter vegetation period. In areas prone to prolonged tidal flooding, traditional varieties with higher levels of salt tolerance can be chosen. The method of crop establishment can also influence the yield in salt-affected areas. For example, farmers can control the water quality better in the nursery field than on the field after sowing by adopting transplanting as a crop establishment method. Effective water management can mitigate soil salinity. The choice of the appropriate irrigation technique can be a fine line between saving water and maintaining low salinity soil levels. Crop rotations with less susceptible crops and alternative land use, such as rice-shrimp rotations, are further options to adapt to changing environmental conditions and mitigate farmer's income loss.

What are the potential long-term impacts of shrimp farming on soil salinity and how does it affect the sustainability of rice-shrimp rotational systems in the context of climate change?	Shrimp farming can lead to soil salinization, which is identified as one of the major long-term impacts of this practice. This increase in soil salinity can affect the sustainability of rice-shrimp rotational systems, especially in the context of climate change. The rice-shrimp system involves growing rice during the monsoon season and shrimp in the dry season under higher salinity levels. Ideally, the monsoon drains the field from salt, enabling rice transplanting. However, with climate change and an expected shift in precipitation patterns, this system could lead to a loss of valuable freshwater early in the season as it is needed to remove the salt from the system. As a result, farmers' dependence on the intensity of the remaining precipitation increases, which makes the sustainability of this system questionable. Furthermore, the intensification and expansion of rice-shrimp cultivation can lead to an increase in salinity-affected areas.	['(2015) recommended a shift in agricultural produc -\ntion, mainly towards rice-aquaculture or rice-upland crop rotation for 180,000 ha in order to adapt to a 30 cm sea level rise.In rice-shrimp systems, rice is grown during monsoon season alternately shrimp in the dry season under higher salinity levels (5–40 ppt  \n(FAO, 1986).In an ideal world, the onset of the monsoon drains the field from salt and enables field preparation and rice transplanting.Indeed, shrimp farming was highly promoted to farmers in semi-coastal areas in recent years and farmers practising shrimp-rice rotational systems had on average 50% higher income than farm -\ners practising two rice crops (Anh, Kroeze, Bush, & Mol, 2010; Hossain & Hasan, 2017; Smajgl et al., 2015).In view of climate change and an expected shift of precipitation patterns, however, this system leads to a loss of highly valuable freshwater early in the season, because it is needed to remove the salt from the sys -\ntem (Christensen et al., 2013).As a consequence, farmers depend on the intensity of the remaining precipitation rendering the sus -\ntainability of this system questionable.In addition to effluents loaded with environmentally critical substances, soil salinization has been identified as one of the major long-terms impacts of shrimp culture (Ali, 2006; Anh et al., 2010; Chowdhury, Khairun, Salequzzaman, & Rahman,  2011; Clarke et  al., 2015).Therefore, \nintensification and expansion of rice-shrimp cultivation can lead to an increase in salinity-affected areas.Although the beneficial po-tential of diversified production is recognized, spatial-explicit suit -\nability as well as large scale and long-term impacts need to be assessed.Integrated water resource models describe hydrological \n\u200a3Parts per thousand.1439037x, 2020, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jac.12415 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [10/08/2023].See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License', 'Policy study on The Probable Impacts \nof Climate Change on Poverty and Economic Growth and and the Options of Coping with Adverse Effects of Climate Change in Bangladesh .Ghosh, B., Md, N.

What are the potential impacts of alterations in freshwater availability and seawater intrusion induced by climate change on rice production in the Mekong Delta, according to the report by Schneider and Asch?	The alterations in freshwater availability and seawater intrusion induced by climate change could have significant impacts on rice production in the Mekong Delta. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong Delta, or about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, are at high risk. Groundwater, which is an important source for municipal and industrial water demands, is expected to undergo substantial changes due to climate change, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise are ranging between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland and increase salinity in freshwater at various locations. This could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land, leading to an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.	['| \u2003503\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nThanh, N. C.

Based on the report, how do anthropogenic developments and natural hazards interact to increase saltwater intrusion, and how does this impact the quality and production of rice in the Mekong Delta?	Anthropogenic developments such as high dikes, sand mining, upstream dams, and groundwater extraction can interact with natural hazards like typhoons, sea level rise, and droughts to increase saltwater intrusion. High dikes, while useful for keeping out floodwaters and salt intrusion, reduce fertile silt deposits. Sand mining and upstream dams reduce natural freshwater flooding and trap sediments in reservoirs, which can affect sediment accumulation. Groundwater extraction can cause land subsidence, further exacerbating saltwater intrusion. Natural hazards like typhoons and sea level rise can induce saltwater flooding and worsen salinity intrusion. Droughts can also increase the extent of salinity intrusion due to a lack of fresh water. Climate change may intensify these effects by increasing the frequency and severity of these natural disasters.These interactions can have a negative impact on the quality and production of rice in the Mekong Delta. Saltwater intrusion can limit rice production areas, forcing many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops. The reduction in fertile silt deposits due to high dikes and the reduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams can decrease rice growing areas. Furthermore, the use of high agrochemical inputs to compensate for these losses can affect rice quality.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.']
Based on the context, what makes the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam a highly vulnerable area to environmental hazards?	The Mekong River Delta (MRD) in Vietnam is highly vulnerable to environmental hazards due to several factors. Firstly, it is a highly populated area with 17.8 million people, many of whom are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. The delta is also a significant hub for rice production, with 54% of Vietnam's rice grown there, making it crucial for the Vietnamese economy and global food security. The soils in the MRD are highly variable, with alluvial, acid sulfate, and saline soils dominant, and most of the rice grows in the highly fertile alluvial soils, which are found in only 30% of the delta. Additionally, the MRD has a tropical monsoon climate with two distinct seasons, a dry season and a rainy season, which could potentially lead to environmental hazards such as floods and droughts. Lastly, the delta is low-lying, with elevations ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 m above sea level, making it susceptible to sea-level rise and other climate change impacts.	['In this paper, we focus on the Red River Delta (RRD) and\nthe Mekong River Delta (MRD) in Vietnam as these two\ndeltas are highly populated hubs of agricultural production\nthat are highly vulnerable to environmental hazards.We use\na systems-thinking approach to illustrate some of the wicked\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1475\nprovide a holistic and contextualized overview of the threats\nfaced in each location.2 Methods\n2.1 Study sites\nThe Mekong River Delta (MRD) is the world’s third-largest\ndelta, with a physical area of 4 million ha, and it is the\nlarger of the two deltas in Vietnam (Schneider and Asch,\n2020; Fig.1).In 2018, the planted area for spring, autumn\nand winter paddies was 1.6 million ha, 2.3 million ha and\n197.2 thousand ha, respectively.In total, 4.1 million ha of rice\nwas planted over the three planting seasons, with 24.5 million\ntonnes of rice produced.The delta is home to 17.8 million\npeople, with many dependent on agriculture for their liveli-\nhoods.That 54 % of Vietnam’s rice is grown in the MRD, and\nmost of it is exported overseas, makes it strategically impor-\ntant for the Vietnamese economy and for global food security\n(Chapman et al., 2016; Cosslett and Cosslett, 2018; General\nStatistics Ofﬁce of Vietnam, 2020).Up north, the Red River\nDelta (RRD) is the next largest, with a physical delta area of\n1.5 million ha (Fig.1; Schneider and Asch, 2020).In 2018,\n1 million ha of planted rice produced 6.3 million tonnes of\nrice, the equivalent of 14 % of Vietnam’s total rice produc-\ntion (524.3 and 516.4 thousand ha of rice was planted in\nthe spring and winter seasons, respectively).Approximately\n21.6 million people live in the RRD, with many also de-\npendent on agriculture (General Statistics Ofﬁce of Vietnam,\n2020).Soils in the MRD are highly variable, with alluvial, acid\nsulfate and saline soils dominant.Most of the rice grows\nin the highly fertile alluvial soils, which are found in only\n30 % of the delta (GRSP, 2013).Conversely, soils in the RRD\nconsist of Holocene delta sediments.These Holocene delta\nsediments are relatively ﬁne-grained muds and sands, up to\n30 m thick, that are the product of rapid progradation during\nthe Holocene high sea level stand (Mathers and Zalasiewicz,\n1999).The Holocene sequence overlies coarse-grained Pleis-\ntocene sediments dominated by braided river and alluvial fan\ndeposits formed during the last glacial low sea level stand.The Quaternary sediments are underlain by a >400 m thick\nlayer of Neogene sedimentary rocks that are made up of con-\nglomerate sandstone, clay and siltstone (Berg et al., 2007).Climatically, the MRD has a tropical monsoon climate\nwith two distinct seasons, a dry season from December to\nApril and a rainy season from May to November.It is gen-\nerally warm year round, with average temperatures in 2018\nranging from 26◦C in December, January and February to\n29◦C in May.The annual rainfall is between 2000 and\n2400 mm (General Statistics Ofﬁce, 2018; Kotera et al.,\n2008).Conversely, the RRD has a tropical monsoon climate\nwith three seasons: (1) a hot and wet season from May to\nSeptember, (2) a cool and dry season from October to Jan-uary, and (3) a cool and humid season from February to\nApril.The hot and wet season is characterized by high tem-\nperatures and high rainfall, the cool and dry season has mod-\nerate to low temperatures and low rainfall, and the cool and\nhumid season has low to moderate temperatures and low\nrainfall (Huong et al., 2013; Li et al., 2006).In 2018, the\nmonthly average temperatures in the RRD ranged from 17◦C\nin February to 30◦C in June.Average annual rainfall is be-\ntween 1300 and 1800 mm (Li et al., 2006; General Statis-\ntics Ofﬁce, 2018).Both deltas are low-lying, with elevations\nranging from 0.7 to 1.2 m a.s.l.(above sea level) (Binh et al.,\n2017).']
"""How has worsening saltwater intrusion affected rice production in the Mekong Delta, and what alternative crops are farmers turning to in response to this environmental threat?"""	Worsening saltwater intrusion, particularly during the dry season, has a significant impact on rice production in the Mekong Delta. This environmental threat has led to increased soil salinization, resulting in a loss of land available for rice production. Approximately 1.8 million hectares in the Mekong River Delta are already affected by dry-season salinity, and this area is predicted to increase with rising sea levels. In response to these challenges, farmers are turning to alternative crops and aquaculture, which are less affected by these environmental conditions. However, the context does not specify which alternative crops are being used.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities;

"""How does the interaction of anthropogenic land-use factors and natural hazards influence rice productivity in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam?"""	Anthropogenic land-use factors and natural hazards interact in various ways to influence rice productivity in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. For instance, environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops like coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion is another factor that has reduced rice growing areas. However, agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high despite shrinking growing areas.The construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields, but these dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Other human activities unrelated to agriculture, such as sand mining and dam construction, can reduce rice productivity by reducing sediment availability and increasing channel erosion.Natural hazards like typhoons, floods, and droughts can also damage rice crops. Rice damage is worse if a typhoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods. Floods can be caused by heavy monsoonal rains, and while moderate levels of freshwater flooding may be beneficial to agricultural production, severe floods can cause damage. Droughts, though uncommon, have caused significant economic loss in the agriculture sector.In the future, climate change may exacerbate the effects of natural hazards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters. This could lead to an increase in problems such as excessive saltwater flooding and saltwater intrusion, which can further impact rice productivity.	['1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1487\nland and water pollution and reduces crop quality.In addi-\ntion, anthropogenic developments such as dike construction\ncan improve agricultural productivity but also create unin-\ntended environmental problems.Even human activities that\nare unrelated to agriculture such as sand mining, groundwa-\nter extraction and dam construction can reduce rice produc-\ntivity.In addition, natural hazards not only affect rice quality\nand quantity but may also amplify some of the problems cre-\nated by human activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level\nrise may induce saltwater ﬂooding and worsen salinity intru-\nsion.In the future, climate change may exacerbate the effects\nof natural hazards by increasing the frequency and severity\nof natural disasters.Therefore, the problems associated with\nsome of the natural hazards such as excessive saltwater ﬂood-\ning and saltwater intrusion may increase in frequency and\nseverity.In sum, the processes and issues affecting food se-\ncurity are multidimensional and interdependent, and we used\na systems-thinking approach to develop a visual represen-\ntation of the ways in which anthropogenic land-use factors\nand natural hazards can affect rice quantity and quality in the\nMRD and the RRD in Vietnam.We have also sought to de-\nﬁne whether the anthropogenic or natural-hazard driver was a\nlocal, regional or global driver to highlight the scale at which\neach driver operates.Our review focuses on food security in Vietnam’s two\ndeltas but can be applied to other contexts.The problems\npresent in the two deltas in Vietnam are hardly unique.Across the world, deltas are global food production hubs that\nsupport large populations.Nearly half a billion people live in\ndeltaic regions.Similar to the Mekong and Red River deltas,\nlarge tracts of deltaic wetlands in other countries have been\nreclaimed for agriculture, aquaculture, and urban and indus-\ntrial land use.Resultantly, many deltas suffer from ﬂood-\ning, retreating shorelines due to upstream dams, pollution\nproblems, and increasing land subsidence due to groundwa-\nter and mineral extraction.With climate change, rising sea\nlevels will further threaten the viability of the deltaic land-\nform (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Day et al., 2016; Giosan et al.,\n2014; Syvitski et al., 2009).Given that river deltas worldwide are highly stressed and\ndegraded, a systems-thinking approach can provide a holis-\ntic overview of the “wicked problems” faced in each loca-\ntion and how the various environmental processes interact\nwith each other.Although our study has focused on rice agri-\nculture in the two deltas in Vietnam, the application of a\nsystems-thinking approach to evaluate other pertinent phe-\nnomena in deltas elsewhere is a useful tool for understand-\ning how human activities, natural hazards and climate change\nhave compromised deltaic sustainability.Data availability.The papers used in this study are listed in the\nSupplement.Supplement.The supplement related to this article is available on-\nline at: https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021-supplement.Author contributions.KW and JSH came up with the idea for this\nproject.KW reviewed papers and wrote the manuscript with dis-\ncussions and improvements from all co-authors.JSH, AD, PT, TTH\nand VDQ provided feedback on the analysis of data and helped in\nrevisions of the manuscript.JSH provided ﬁnancial support for this\npaper.Competing interests.The authors declare that they have no conﬂict\nof interest.Acknowledgements.We thank Khoi Dang Kim, Jose Ma Luis Pan-\ngalangan Montesclaros and Nghiem Thi Phuong Le for their advice.We greatly appreciate the constructive comments and detailed feed-\nback by our reviewers.Financial support.This research has been supported by the Earth\nObservatory of Singapore (grant no.M4430263.B50.706022) via\nits funding from the National Research Foundation Singapore and\nthe Singapore Ministry of Education under the Research Centres of\nExcellence initiative.This work comprises EOS contribution num-\nber 360.\nReview statement.']
"""What is the dominant type of soil in the Mekong River Delta where most of the rice grows, and how might this soil type be affected by salinity intrusion?"""	The dominant type of soil in the Mekong River Delta where most of the rice grows is the highly fertile alluvial soil. This type of soil is found in only 30% of the delta. Salinity intrusion, which can be exacerbated by factors such as sea level rise and droughts, can potentially affect this soil type negatively. High salinity levels can degrade the soil quality, which in turn can impact the growth and productivity of the rice crops.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1475\nprovide a holistic and contextualized overview of the threats\nfaced in each location.2 Methods\n2.1 Study sites\nThe Mekong River Delta (MRD) is the world’s third-largest\ndelta, with a physical area of 4 million ha, and it is the\nlarger of the two deltas in Vietnam (Schneider and Asch,\n2020; Fig.1).In 2018, the planted area for spring, autumn\nand winter paddies was 1.6 million ha, 2.3 million ha and\n197.2 thousand ha, respectively.In total, 4.1 million ha of rice\nwas planted over the three planting seasons, with 24.5 million\ntonnes of rice produced.The delta is home to 17.8 million\npeople, with many dependent on agriculture for their liveli-\nhoods.That 54 % of Vietnam’s rice is grown in the MRD, and\nmost of it is exported overseas, makes it strategically impor-\ntant for the Vietnamese economy and for global food security\n(Chapman et al., 2016; Cosslett and Cosslett, 2018; General\nStatistics Ofﬁce of Vietnam, 2020).Up north, the Red River\nDelta (RRD) is the next largest, with a physical delta area of\n1.5 million ha (Fig.1; Schneider and Asch, 2020).In 2018,\n1 million ha of planted rice produced 6.3 million tonnes of\nrice, the equivalent of 14 % of Vietnam’s total rice produc-\ntion (524.3 and 516.4 thousand ha of rice was planted in\nthe spring and winter seasons, respectively).Approximately\n21.6 million people live in the RRD, with many also de-\npendent on agriculture (General Statistics Ofﬁce of Vietnam,\n2020).Soils in the MRD are highly variable, with alluvial, acid\nsulfate and saline soils dominant.Most of the rice grows\nin the highly fertile alluvial soils, which are found in only\n30 % of the delta (GRSP, 2013).Conversely, soils in the RRD\nconsist of Holocene delta sediments.These Holocene delta\nsediments are relatively ﬁne-grained muds and sands, up to\n30 m thick, that are the product of rapid progradation during\nthe Holocene high sea level stand (Mathers and Zalasiewicz,\n1999).The Holocene sequence overlies coarse-grained Pleis-\ntocene sediments dominated by braided river and alluvial fan\ndeposits formed during the last glacial low sea level stand.The Quaternary sediments are underlain by a >400 m thick\nlayer of Neogene sedimentary rocks that are made up of con-\nglomerate sandstone, clay and siltstone (Berg et al., 2007).Climatically, the MRD has a tropical monsoon climate\nwith two distinct seasons, a dry season from December to\nApril and a rainy season from May to November.It is gen-\nerally warm year round, with average temperatures in 2018\nranging from 26◦C in December, January and February to\n29◦C in May.The annual rainfall is between 2000 and\n2400 mm (General Statistics Ofﬁce, 2018; Kotera et al.,\n2008).Conversely, the RRD has a tropical monsoon climate\nwith three seasons: (1) a hot and wet season from May to\nSeptember, (2) a cool and dry season from October to Jan-uary, and (3) a cool and humid season from February to\nApril.The hot and wet season is characterized by high tem-\nperatures and high rainfall, the cool and dry season has mod-\nerate to low temperatures and low rainfall, and the cool and\nhumid season has low to moderate temperatures and low\nrainfall (Huong et al., 2013; Li et al., 2006).In 2018, the\nmonthly average temperatures in the RRD ranged from 17◦C\nin February to 30◦C in June.Average annual rainfall is be-\ntween 1300 and 1800 mm (Li et al., 2006; General Statis-\ntics Ofﬁce, 2018).Both deltas are low-lying, with elevations\nranging from 0.7 to 1.2 m a.s.l.(above sea level) (Binh et al.,\n2017).', 'K.

"""How many rice crops are produced annually in the Mekong River Delta and what were their respective production volumes in 2018?"""	In the Mekong River Delta, three rice crops are produced annually: spring, autumn, and winter paddies. In 2018, the planted area for these crops was 1.6 million ha, 2.3 million ha, and 197.2 thousand ha, respectively. The total rice production for that year was 24.5 million tonnes.	['K. W.

In the Mekong River Delta, salinity intrusion\nis a naturally occurring phenomenon during the dry season.\nTides from the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand\nbring saltwater inland, and salinity intrudes up to 70–90 km\ninland as the length of sea dikes is limited. There are 1500 km\nof sea and estuary dikes in RRD versus 450 km of sea dikes\nin the MRD (Le et al., 2018; Preston et al., 2003; Pilarcyzk\nand Nguyen, 2005). Thus, salinity intrusion extends up to20 km from the main river in the RRD (Ca et al., 1994). As\nrice plants are unable to thrive in soils with soil salinities ex-\nceeding 4 g L−1(V . H. T. Pham et al., 2018), affected farmers\nhave converted their paddy ﬁelds into aquaculture ponds to\ncultivate shrimp and ﬁsh instead. Other farmers have turned\nto planting salinity-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango\nand sugarcane. In some cases, farmers have opted for a rice-\naquaculture system, whereby rice is planted in the wet sea-\nson, and ﬁsh and shrimp are cultivated in the dry season,\nwhen soil salinities are high (Nguyen and V o, 2017; Pham\net al., 2017).\nBesides environmental factors, the greater proﬁtability of\nfruits, vegetables, ﬁsh and shrimp also incentivizes farmers\nto plant more non-rice crops. The income per hectare of\nrice was USD 146 compared to pomelo (USD 16 844) and\ncoconut (USD 1484) (Hoang and Tran, 2019). Meanwhile,\nfarmers who practice shrimp–rice rotational systems earned\n50 % more than those who had two rice crops (Morton, 2020;\nSchneider and Asch, 2020). In addition, high demand for\nfruits and vegetables for export and from growing urban pop-\nulations with greater afﬂuence and knowledge about nutrition\nalso encouraged farmers to diversify from rice monoculture,\nleading to possible declines in the overall rice growing area\n(Hai, 2021; Nguyen and V o, 2017; Fig. 4).\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.

"""What does the report suggest about the impact of anthropogenic drivers on rice productivity in the Mekong Delta?"""	The report suggests that anthropogenic drivers have significantly impacted rice productivity in the Mekong Delta. Some of these drivers include land-use changes, urban expansion, and environmental threats. Higher prices and rising demand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incentivized farmers to shift from rice monoculture to non-rice crops. Environmental threats, such as worsening saltwater intrusion, have limited rice production areas, forcing farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or grow salt-tolerant crops like coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion has also reduced rice-growing areas. However, agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high despite shrinking growing areas. The construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields, but these dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt, forcing farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields.	['1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.', '1478 K.

"""What are the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the Mekong Delta, and how have government policies and urban expansion impacted the use of paddy land in this region?"""	The key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the Mekong Delta include land-use change, agrochemical use, and government policies. Government policies have encouraged farmers to move away from growing rice, leading to an increase in the planting of non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there has been an increased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards, and freshwater and brackish aquaculture. This shift was facilitated by government regulations, salt intrusion, and the higher profitability of aquaculture productions. Urban expansion, particularly in Can Tho city, has also significantly impacted the use of paddy land in the Mekong Delta. Rapid urbanization has led to the loss of agricultural land, which in turn means a decline in rice growing areas. High land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land have forced farmers to practice agricultural intensification.

What are the effects of the overuse of pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers on the natural predators of rice pests in the Mekong Delta, and how does this impact the required dosage of pesticides in the future?	The overuse of pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers in the Mekong Delta can have a detrimental impact on the natural predators of rice pests, such as spiders, ants, bees, beetles, dragonflies, frogs, ladybugs, and wasps. This is because the excessive use of pesticides can kill these natural enemies. Additionally, the pests targeted by the pesticides may develop resistance to them. As a result, higher doses of the pesticide may be needed in the future to kill them. For instance, killing planthoppers now requires a pesticide dose 500 times larger than was needed in the past.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1479\ndue to intensiﬁed cropping practices involving the use of\nnew high yielding rice varieties, irrigation during the dry sea-\nson and high inputs of agrochemicals (Drebold, 2017; Mor-\nton, 2020).The high pesticide use was reﬂected in a study\nin Nam Dinh Province in the RRD, where 8 out of 12 tar-\nget pesticides were found in agricultural soils.In this study,\nfrequently detected pesticides include isoprothiolane, chlor-\npyrifos and propiconazole, and besides polluting the envi-\nronment, the presence of high concentrations of pesticide\nresidues also lowers the quality of rice sold for consumption\n(Braun et al., 2018; Fig.4).In general, pests such as the brown planthopper are nat-\nurally occurring and are not a threat at low densities.How-\never, intensive rice production with high seeding densities\nand the use of susceptible varieties create a constant sup-\nply of food, which allows their numbers to balloon.This is\nexacerbated by the asynchronous planting, which creates a\ncontinuous supply of rice plants throughout the year in the\nMekong River Delta.In addition, the overuse of nitrogen fer-\ntilizers increases the pests’ reproductive potential.Thirdly,\nthe excessive use of pesticides also kills the natural ene-\nmies of pests such as spiders, ants, bees, beetles, dragonﬂies,\nfrogs, ladybugs and wasps.Besides killing the natural preda-\ntors of rice pests, the pests targeted by the pesticides may also\nbecome resistant to the pesticide.As a result, higher doses of\nthe pesticide may be needed to kill them in the future.For\nexample, killing planthoppers now requires a pesticide dose\n500 times larger than was needed in the past (Normile, 2013).The overuse of pesticide is due to a combination of factors\nsuch as insufﬁcient knowledge of its proper use as well as\naggressive marketing by agrochemical companies (Bottrell\nand Schoenly, 2012; Normile, 2013; Sebesvari et al., 2011).The dashed lines in Fig.4 show that pesticide use may not\nnecessarily reduce the incidence of pests and diseases if ex-\ncessive volumes were applied.3.1.3 Dikes\nWet-season ﬂooding is a naturally occurring phenomenon\nin the two deltas of Vietnam (Chan et al., 2012, 2015).To\nfacilitate the planting of rice during the wet season, ﬂood\nprevention dikes were constructed to keep ﬂoodwaters out\n(Fig.5).The MRD has more than 13 000 km of ﬂood preven-\ntion dikes, of which 8000 km are low dikes below 2 m tall.These low dikes were mostly constructed before 2000 to de-\nlay the entry of ﬂoodwaters at the start of the monsoon season\nto allow two rice crops to be grown.A severe ﬂood in 2000\nprovided the impetus for river dikes to be heightened to 3.5 m\nto completely keep ﬂoodwaters out.These high dikes have\nfacilitated triple-cropping in the MRD, particularly in Dong\nThap and An Giang provinces (Chapman et al., 2016; Howie,\n2005; Le et al., 2018; Triet et al., 2017).However, the pres-\nence of high dikes in the MRD has reduced the supply of fer-\ntile alluvium, increasing the need for artiﬁcial fertilizers and\npesticides to maintain yields (Chapman et al., 2017; Fig.4).Figure 5.Example of a river dike for ﬂood control in Nam Dinh\nProvince in the Red River Delta.A study comparing sediment deposition in areas of high\nand low dikes in An Giang Province found that double-\ncropping farmers who cultivate their crops in areas with low\ndikes have an average of 2.5 cm of sediment deposition.This\ndeposition by ﬂoodwaters improved their average annual in-\nput efﬁciency by 0.3 t of yield per tonne of fertilizer.Con-\nversely, triple-cropping farmers had very little deposition, av-\neraging 0.5 cm as the high dikes kept ﬂoodwaters out.', 'K.

"""How does the presence of poorly maintained dikes potentially increase the risk of flooding in the Mekong Delta region?"""	Poorly maintained dikes in the Mekong Delta region may not effectively keep floodwaters out, leading to an increased risk of flooding. Furthermore, dikes, while designed to protect against flooding and salt intrusion, can also result in a reduction of fertile silt deposits. This is because they prevent the natural flow of water and sediments that would typically contribute to the delta's growth and fertility. Additionally, other human activities such as sand mining and groundwater extraction can exacerbate the risk of flooding.

What are the measures taken to prevent salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta and how does sand mining affect the frequency of flooding and soil fertility in the region?	The Mekong River Delta (MRD) and the Red River Delta (RRD) have implemented measures such as river and flood control dikes, sea dikes, and salinization prevention dikes to protect the area from salinity intrusion. Specifically, in the MRD, there are 1290 km of salinization prevention dikes and 450 km of sea dikes.Sand mining in the MRD has significant impacts on the frequency of flooding and soil fertility. Large-scale sand mining operations have created pits and pools that trap sediments, preventing them from traveling downstream and contributing to the delta's growth. This process also leads to bed incision, causing land loss and threatening rice-growing areas. A study found that the frequency of flooding in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle in the MRD had dropped by 7.8% from 2005–2015 due to sand mining. This decrease in flood frequency reduces the volume of water and sediments for agricultural production. Floodwaters typically deposit fertile sediments and flush out pesticides and fertilizers from intensive agricultural production. When flood frequency decreases, the frequency at which farmlands benefit from this natural soil quality enhancement also decreases. This could lead to a decrease in soil fertility over time and result in declines in rice yields unless artificial fertilizers are added.	['1480 K. W.

How has the increased groundwater extraction affected land subsidence and the severity of saltwater intrusion in the Mekong River Delta, and what impact does this have on the suitability of land for rice cultivation?	Increased groundwater extraction has amplified land subsidence in the Mekong River Delta, with subsidence rates from groundwater extraction ranging between 1.1 and 2.5 cm per year. This has led to an increase in the severity and extent of saltwater intrusion. The cumulative effect of 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 has resulted in an average of 18 cm of subsidence, with some areas recording over 30 cm of subsidence. This land subsidence, caused by excessive groundwater extraction, has increased the vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and decreased the availability of land suitable for rice production. Furthermore, rice crops can become contaminated with arsenic when arsenic-rich groundwater is discharged into rivers and used for rice irrigation, reducing the quality of the crop.	['While groundwater extraction has increased the availability\nof water for human activities, it has exacerbated land subsi-\ndence, which has increased the severity and extent of salt-\nwater intrusion and reduced the suitability of land for rice\ncultivation (Fig.4).Minderhoud et al.(2017) developed a\n3D numerical groundwater ﬂow model of the MRD surface\nand found that subsidence rates from groundwater extraction\nwere between 1.1 and 2.5 cm yr−1.The model also showed\nthat 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 had re-\nsulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence, with\nsome hotspots recording over 30 cm of subsidence.Land sub-\nsidence from excessive groundwater extraction acts as a cat-\nalyst that increases vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and\nreduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.Moreover, rice crops become contaminated with arsenic\nwhen arsenic-rich groundwater used for non-agricultural use\nis discharged into rivers, and the river water is used for rice ir-\nrigation (Lan and Giao, 2017; Minderhoud et al., 2018).High\narsenic concentrations in groundwater seem to be of natu-\nral origin.In the Mekong River Delta, naturally occurring\nbiochemical and hydrological processes cause As to be re-\nleased from Fe oxides in rocks and sediments into groundwa-\nter reservoirs (Fendorf et al., 2010).In addition, deep ground-\nwater extraction causes interbedded clays to compact and ex-\npel water containing dissolved As (Erban et al., 2013).Crop\nquality is reduced when the arsenic-enriched water is de-\nposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth\n(Rahman and Hasegawa, 2011; Fig.4).Similarly, prevalence of groundwater extraction is also\nhigh in the Red River Delta.Approximately 70 % of the\npopulation living in the RRD accesses water from Holocene\nand Pleistocene aquifers (Berg et al., 2007; Winkel et al.,\n2011).Groundwater in the Red River Delta is also contam-\ninated with high levels of As due to reductive dissolution\nof As from iron oxyhydroxides in buried sediment (Berg et\nal., 2007; Luu, 2019).Berg et al.(2007) sampled 196 tube\nwells randomly over a 700 km2area in the Red River Delta,\nand the concentrations of As in groundwater ranged from\n1 to 3050 µg L−1, with an average of 159 µg L−1.Separately,\nWinkel et al.(2011) collected 512 water samples from pri-\nvate wells in the Red River ﬂoodplain and found As concen-\ntrations varying from <0.1 to 810 µg L−1, with 27 % of the\nsamples exceeding the WHO guideline value of 10 µg L−1.Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K.

What is the impact of upstream dam development on sediment transport and erosion in the Mekong Delta?	Upstream dam development significantly impacts sediment transport and erosion in the Mekong Delta. Dams trap a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel, and suspended sediment in the reservoirs behind them, preventing this material from being transported downstream. This reduction in sediment load can exacerbate erosion downstream from the dam. Under a scenario of 38 new dams, the cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River Delta would be 51%. If 133 new dams were built, only 4% of the pre-dam sediment load would reach the delta. Even if dam construction was limited to the river tributaries instead of the main stem, about 68% of the sediment could be trapped, meaning that only about 32% of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River Delta. A study found that the suspended sediment loads in the Mekong River Delta had decreased by 74.1% in 2012–2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang cascade in China.	['In particular, the Manwan and Dachaoshan\ndams contributed to 32 % of the reduction.In addition,\nfrom 2014–2017, the average incision rate of the Tien River\nin the MRD was 3 times higher than the previously recorded\nvalue.Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of\n14.8 % of the annual riverbed incision, while the remainder\nwas caused by hydropower dams upstream.The deleterious impacts of dams on sediment loads can\nalso be found in the Red River Delta in spite of the smaller\nnumber of dams.While the Hoa Binh dam is located on a\ntributary of the Red River in Vietnam, its large size has in-\nﬂuenced suspended sediment distribution in the lower Red\nRiver basin.For example, an analysis of the suspended sedi-\nment concentration over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010\nshowed that yearly suspended sediment ﬂux had dropped by\n61 % at Son Tay near Hanoi (Vinh et al., 2014).Similarly,\nDuc et al.(2012) calculated that the suspended sediment bud-\nget at Son Tay and Hanoi hydrological monitoring stations\nwas reduced by 56 % after the Hoa Binh dam became oper-\national in 1989.The reduction in sediment loads at the Red\nRiver Delta would likewise have a similar impact on delta\nsize and rice growing areas.Besides a change in sediment loads, dams also alter stream\ndischarge and water levels, with concurrent effects on wa-\nter supplies (not shown in Fig.4).When water levels are\nhigh during the rainy season, dams can be used to impound\nthe excess water in the reservoir behind.During the dry sea-\nson, when water levels are lower, the dams can release wa-\nter downstream.In doing so, dams increase dry-season dis-\ncharge and decrease wet-season discharge.The modiﬁcation\nof seasonal water ﬂows is problematic as changes in natu-\nral ﬂow patterns, such as higher ﬂows in the dry season and\nlower ﬂows in the wet season, would affect rice production\nas rice growing calendars are currently linked to the natu-\nral ﬂuctuations in high and low ﬂows (Robert, 2017).Hence,\nchanges in water levels due to anthropogenic interventions\nmay create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if plant-\ning calendars remain unchanged.In addition, lowered water\nlevels during dry seasons due to upstream water impound-\nment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion and create\nunfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1481\nThe high concentrations of As reduce the quality of rice har-\nvested in the RRD if As gets into soils and river waters indi-\nrectly through the usage of As-enriched groundwater (Fig.4).In a study on As accumulation in white rice from the Red\nRiver region in Vietnam, Phuong et al.(1999) reported As\nvalues of between 0.03 and 0.47 µg g−1d wt with the mean\nvalue at 0.21 µg g−1d wt.The mean value was higher than the\nmean value reported for Thai rice (0.14 µg g−1d wt; range:\n0.01 to 0.39 µg g−1) (Meharg et al., 2009).Lastly, although high As concentrations in groundwater\nare common in the RRD (cf.Berg et al., 2007; Luu, 2019;\nH. V .Pham et al., 2018; Winkel et al., 2011), there is no re-\nsearch on (groundwater induced) land subsidence in the Red\nRiver Delta.Thus, the magnitude of land subsidence in the\ndelta is uncertain and should be an area for future research.3.2 Regional anthropogenic drivers\n3.2.1 Upstream dams\nThe Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau and\nﬂows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo-\ndia and southern Vietnam.To meet growing demands for\nelectricity, many small- and large-scale hydropower projects\nhave been commissioned in each country to take advantage\nof this supposedly green and clean source of energy (Nhan\nand Cao, 2019; Manh et al., 2015).A total of 241 dams\nhave been completed in the entire Mekong basin, with an-\nother 29 under construction.A further 91 are currently be-\ning planned.These 361 dams consist of 176 hydropower\ndams and 185 irrigation dams.Of the 364 dams in the\nMekong, 20 are in Vietnamese territory (WLE Mekong\nCGIAR, 2020a).Conversely, the Red River originates in\nYunnan Province in China and ﬂows towards northern Viet-\nnam.It is less heavily dammed, with a total of 105 dams in\nChina and Vietnam.There are 25 hydropower dams, 3 multi-\npurpose dams and 9 irrigation dams in the Red River basin in\nVietnam (Vinh et al., 2014; WLE Mekong CGIAR, 2020b).While there are no dams in the Mekong River Delta or the\nRed River Delta due to their relatively ﬂat elevation, up-\nstream dam development inﬂuences downstream regions in\nmany ways, with the environmental impacts extending far\nbeyond the dam itself (Kondolf et al., 2014).Firstly, a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel and\nsuspended sediment is impounded in reservoirs behind the\ndams instead of being transported downstream.This dimin-\nished sediment load may aggravate erosion downstream from\nthe dam (Nhan and Cao, 2019; Fig.4).Using a network\nmodel, under a “deﬁnitive future” scenario of 38 new dams,\nthe cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River\nDelta would be 51 %.Conversely, under full build-up of\n133 new dams, only 4 % of the pre-dam sediment load will\nreach the delta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Manh et al.(2015)\nalso reached similar conclusions with a quasi-2D hydrody-\nnamic model of suspended sediment dynamics.Floodplainsedimentation would decrease by about 21 % to 96 %, while\nsediment load supplied to the sea at the river will diminish by\n1 % to 95 %, with the extreme values representing full dam\nbuild-up.Even if dam construction was limited to the river\ntributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment\ntrapped could be as high as 68 %, meaning that only about\n32 % of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River\nDelta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Indeed, Binh et al.(2020) found that the suspended sed-\niment loads in the MRD had decreased by 74.1 % in 2012–\n2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang\ncascade in China.']
"""How do changes in water levels due to dams and other human interventions contribute to increased saltwater intrusion and create unfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers in the Mekong Delta?"""	Changes in water levels due to dams and other human interventions can have several negative impacts on the growing conditions for rice farmers in the Mekong Delta. For instance, upstream dams can affect sediment accumulation as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream. This can lead to a reduction in fertile silt deposits, which are crucial for rice farming. Additionally, sand mining can increase channel erosion and reduce the frequency of natural freshwater flooding, further exacerbating the problem. Groundwater extraction can cause land subsidence, which can lead to saltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination. These factors can negatively affect both the rice growing areas and the quality of rice produced. Furthermore, these human activities can amplify the problems created by natural hazards such as typhoons and sea level rise, which can induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.

How does the occurrence of typhoons and the resulting saltwater flooding affect rice production in the Mekong Delta, considering that rice is not adapted to withstand prolonged submergence and/or saline conditions?	Typhoons are a significant natural hazard that affects rice production in the Mekong Delta. When a typhoon occurs, the affected areas are exposed to strong winds and heavy rainfall, which can lead to widespread flooding. This flooding can be exacerbated by storm surges, which occur when high winds push on the ocean's surface combined with the effect of low pressure in the center of a typhoon. This can lead to saltwater flooding, which is particularly detrimental to rice production as rice is not adapted to withstand prolonged submergence or saline conditions. Therefore, typhoons and the resulting saltwater flooding can significantly reduce rice growing areas and adversely affect rice production.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1483\nIn terms of growth stage, rice plants at the tillering stage are\nmore likely to succumb to submergence than those at the veg-\netative stage.Plants fully submerged for short durations (2 d)\nalso had lower chances of survival than those that were par-\ntially submerged in ﬂoodwaters for longer durations (up to\n8 d).As such the effect of ﬂooding on rice growing areas is\nvariable as other factors that affect crop mortality include the\ntype of rice grown, the stage of rice growth, and the depth\nand length of submergence in ﬂoodwaters (Fig.6).Although severe ﬂooding can disrupt agricultural activi-\nties, moderate levels of freshwater ﬂooding bring beneﬁts\nto (rural) farmers (EEPSEA, 2011).Floodwaters from rivers\nimprove agricultural productivity by depositing nutrient-rich\nﬂood sediments on agricultural soils (Chapman et al., 2016).In addition, ﬂoods wash away contaminants, purify and\nrecharge aquifers, kill pests, and mitigate saltwater intrusion\n(EEPSEA, 2011; Hoang et al., 2018; Fig.6).Aquatic re-\nsources such as ﬁsh, crabs and snails also come in with the\nﬂoodwaters, which local farmers can collect to supplement\ntheir incomes.Besides growing rice, it is also possible to cul-\ntivate vegetables, ﬁsh, prawns and ducks in the ﬂooded ﬁelds\n(Nguyen and James, 2013).Towards the end of the ﬂooding\nseason and the start of the rice cultivation season, ﬂoodwa-\nters provide the water needed to start growing rice (Hoa et\nal., 2008).While there are investments in ﬂood prevention measures\nwith the construction and upgrading of river dikes, the con-\nstruction and dredging of reservoirs and drainage canals, and\nthe raising of roads and embankments, recent ﬂoods have\ncaused substantial agricultural losses as current measures\nhave proven to be inadequate (Hoa et al., 2008; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005).In 2018, 39 000 ha of rice in the RRD\nwas inundated by heavy rains and ﬂoods triggered by Ty-\nphoon Son-Tinh (VNA, 2018a).Similarly, due to a lack of\nembankments and/or poor construction and maintenance of\nexisting embankments, more than 2000 ha of rice was lost\nduring the annual ﬂoods in 2018.An Giang Province was the\nworst-affected, losing 1270 ha of rice (VNA, 2018b).3.3.3 Typhoons\nTyphoons are the most severe natural hazard that affects Viet-\nnam.When a typhoon occurs, affected areas are exposed to\nstrong winds of up to 50 m/s and up to 300 mm of rainfall\nin a day.As the rainy season in Vietnam coincides with the\ntyphoon season, widespread ﬂooding can be expected from\nheavy rain and overﬂowing rivers (CCFSC, 2005; Mai et\nal., 2009; K.-A.Nguyen et al., 2019).Storm surges can also\noccur when high winds pushing on the ocean’s surface are\ncombined with the effect of low pressure in the center of\na typhoon (Takagi et al., 2013).A study of typhoon disas-\nters in Vietnam since 1950 showed that half of the 450 ty-\nphoons recorded during the study period were accompanied\nby a storm surge of over 1 m, and 11 % were over 2.5 m high\n(Imamura and Van To, 1997).In the Red River Delta, Quynhet al.(1998) found that the maximum storm surge is usually\nbetween 1 to 1.5 m a.m.s.l.(above mean sea level).In short,\nrice production will be adversely affected by strong winds\nand widespread ﬂooding from heavy precipitation and storm\nsurges in the event of a typhoon.Saltwater ﬂooding may re-\nduce rice growing areas as rice is not adapted to withstand\nprolonged submergence and/or saline conditions.', '1482 K.

Flow diagram showing the natural hazards that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. Local drivers refer to\nnatural hazards that occur within the two mega-deltas. Although sea level rise has implications on a local scale, it is considered a global\ndriver as it occurs on a global scale. The effect of ﬂooding on rice growing areas is variable as other factors that affect crop mortality include\nthe type of rice grown, the stage of rice growth, and the depth and length of submergence in ﬂoodwaters.\n3.3 Local natural-hazard drivers\n3.3.1 Drought\nDroughts do not result solely from a lack of rainfall; they\ncan also result from changes in the arrival of rains and the\nlength of the wet season (Adamson and Bird, 2010; Lassa et\nal., 2016). Vietnam was affected by droughts in 1997–1998,\n2002–2003, 2009–2010 and most recently in 2015–2016.\nThe 2015–2016 drought was the most severe in 90 years\n(Grosjean et al., 2016). All 13 provinces in the Mekong River\nDelta were affected by the 2015 drought. Besides a lack of\nwater for irrigation, the drought caused saltwater to intrude\nup to 70 km inland. Cumulatively, the drought and accompa-\nnying saltwater intrusion damaged 400 000 ha of rice crops,\nincluding 50 000 ha of paddy in Kien Giang and Ca Mau\nprovinces in the MRD (Grosjean et al., 2016; Nguyen, 2017).\nAlthough there is no research on how droughts and salinity\nintrusion have affected rice quality in Vietnam, research from\nelsewhere has shown that water shortages and salt stress in-\nduce physiochemical alterations which affect the rice grains\nproduced (Pandey et al., 2014; Razzaq et al., 2019; Fig. 6).\nCompared to the MRD, research and reports on droughts\nin the Red River Delta are scarce. The UNW-DPC (2014)reported that the RRD experienced droughts from the end\nof 1998 to April 1999, which affected 86 140 ha of rice. An-\nother drought occurred from January to February 2004, with\nthe water level of the Red River at the lowest in 40 years. Low\nwater levels were also reported in 2010; however drought\nconditions and saltwater intrusion were more severe in the\nMRD (Overland, 2010). The effect of droughts on rice agri-\nculture – reduced yields from a lack of water and salinity\nintrusion – would also be similar in the RRD.\n3.3.2 Freshwater ﬂooding\nRanked as the second most severe natural hazard after ty-\nphoons, freshwater ﬂoods are caused by overﬂowing rivers or\nheavy monsoonal rains or associated with heavy rain from ty-\nphoons (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Hung et al., 2012; McElwee\net al., 2017). Theoretically, ﬂooding reduces rice growing ar-\neas, but it is simplistic to assume that ﬂooded ﬁelds result in\nimmediate loss of rice crops. A study by Kotera et al. (2005)\nin the RRD showed that the type of rice, stage of rice growth,\nand lengths and depths of submergence were factors that in-\nﬂuence the survival rates of rice crops. For example, the local\nvariety Moc Tuyen was less resilient to submergence than\nthe two other genetically improved high-yielding varieties.\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Based on the context, how does the timing and location of a typhoon's landfall affect the extent of damage to agricultural lands, particularly rice fields, in Vietnam?	The extent of damage to agricultural lands, particularly rice fields, in Vietnam due to a typhoon is influenced by the timing and location of the typhoon's landfall. If a typhoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods, the agricultural losses can be significant. The location of landfall also matters. For instance, Typhoon Mirinae in 2016 made landfall in Nam Dinh, damaging or submerging over 225,000 hectares of rice, while Typhoon Nesat in 2011 made landfall in Hai Phong with a similar intensity and caused only 3500 hectares of rice damage. Furthermore, the Mekong River Delta (MRD) is less prone to typhoons, but when they do occur, they can cause significant damage. For example, Typhoon Linda in 1997 and Typhoon Durian in 2006 both caused substantial damage to agricultural land despite being classified as tropical storms upon landfall.	['Addition-\nally, strong winds damage rice plants, with both effects con-\ntributing to a reduction in rice yields (Fig.6).Although a stronger typhoon usually brings higher wind\nspeeds, more rainfall, larger waves and higher storm surges\n(Larson et al., 2014), the quantity of agricultural losses de-\npends on factors such as landfall location(s) and whether the\ntyphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting\nperiods (Masutomi et al., 2012).For example, Typhoon Miri-\nnae (2016), which made landfall in Nam Dinh as a tropical\nstorm, damaged or submerged 225 216 ha of rice.Meanwhile\nTyphoon Nesat (2011) made landfall in Hai Phong with a\nsimilar intensity and caused only 3500 ha of rice damage.Conversely, Typhoon Kalmai (2014) made landfall in Quang\nNinh as a slightly stronger category 1 storm and caused\n20 000 ha of rice damage (Nhân Dân, 2014; United Nations\nVietnam, 2016; Viêt Nam News, 2011).An average of ﬁve to six typhoons affect Vietnam be-\ntween June and November every year (Larson et al., 2014;\nNguyen et al., 2007).Typhoon activity shifts from the north\nto the south as the year progresses.Therefore, peak activ-\nity in the north and southern part of Vietnam is in August\nand November, respectively (Imamura and Van To, 1997).We reviewed the Digital Typhoon (2021) database and found\n303 typhoons that came within 500 km of Vietnam’s coast-\nline from 1995 to 2018.A total of 29 cyclones made their\ninitial landfall in the Red River Delta, while only 4 cyclones\nmade landfall in the Mekong River Delta during the study pe-\nriod – one each in 1973, 1996, 1997 and 2006 (unpublished\nresults).Although the MRD is less prone to typhoons, two\nof the most recent typhoons caused signiﬁcant damage de-\nspite each being classiﬁed as a tropical storm upon landfall.Typhoon Linda (1997) caused some 349 232 ha of rice to be\nsubmerged, while Typhoon Durian (2006) damaged 6978 ha\nof agricultural land (International Federation of Red Cross\nand Red Crescent Society, 2006; UN Department of Human-\nitarian Affairs, 1997).Lastly, typhoons may not necessarily be bad all the time.Darby et al.(2016) combined suspended sediment load data\nfrom the Mekong River with hydrological model simulations\nto examine the role of typhoons in transporting suspended\nsediments and found that one-third (32 %) of the suspended\nsediment reaching the delta is delivered by runoff generated\nby rainfall associated with typhoons.When a typhoon affects\nareas upstream, the land receives higher-than-usual levels of\nrainfall, which may trigger landslides.This sediment can be\ntransferred into rivers and delivered downstream.While the\nrole of tropical typhoons in sediment mobilization is unclear\ngiven the lack of research in this area, such ﬁndings have\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'K.

Based on the context, how has the rising sea level due to climate change increased the risk of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	Rising sea levels, predicted to occur through 2050, could increase the frequency of storm surges, which in turn could lead to breaches in dikes and embankments, causing saltwater flooding. This flooding could damage rice growing areas and other properties. Additionally, accelerated coastal subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction could lead to large portions of low-lying areas being flooded. This facilitates the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, which may increase salinity gradients. The salinity intrusion is expected to worsen during the dry season. Currently, approximately 1.8 million hectares in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) are already affected by dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million hectares are affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1.

"""What are the potential impacts of rising sea levels and accelerated coastal subsidence on the low-lying areas of Mekong River Delta and Red River Delta in Vietnam, particularly in terms of saltwater intrusion and soil salinization?"""	Rising sea levels and accelerated coastal subsidence, particularly caused by excessive groundwater extraction, could lead to large portions of the low-lying Mekong River Delta (MRD) and Red River Delta (RRD) being inundated and flooded. This could facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, potentially increasing salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD. Salinity intrusion could worsen during the dry season. Approximately 1.8 million hectares in the MRD are already affected by dry-season salinity, with 1.3 million hectares affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1. This area is predicted to increase to 2.2 million hectares with rising sea levels. In the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1% salinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km. Increased soil salinization could lead to a loss of land available for rice production. Although there are sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices in both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater, they may be inadequate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.

W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nLikewise, the RRD is also heavily diked, with 3000 km of\nriver dikes (Fig.5), but unlike the MRD, high dikes are ab-\nsent (Pilarcyzk and Nguyen, 2005).Besides river and ﬂood\ncontrol dikes, there are also sea dikes and salinization pre-\nvention dikes in both deltas to protect the area from salinity\nintrusion.There are 1500 km of sea and estuary dikes in the\nRRD.In the MRD, there are 1290 km of salinization preven-\ntion dikes and 450 km of sea dikes (Le et al., 2018; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005; Fig.4).3.1.4 Sand mining\nSand mining is carried out on a large scale in the Mekong\n(Kondolf et al., 2018).Fueled by demand from reclamation,\nexport and construction, 55.2 million tonnes of sediment\nwas extracted from the Mekong main stem in Laos, Thai-\nland, Cambodia and Vietnam from 2011 to 2012 (Bravard\nand Gaillot, 2013; Robert, 2017).A more recent analysis of\nbathymetric maps and the local reﬁlling processes by Jor-\ndan et al.(2019) put the amount of sand extracted from the\nMekong River Delta in 2018 at 17.77 Mm3.Besides removing large quantities of riverbed sediments,\nsand mining operations have created numerous pits and\npools.These pits and pools, which can be up to 45 m deep,\nthen become sediment traps, trapping bed loads from up-\nstream reaches and preventing them from traveling down-\nstream and contributing to the continued presence and\ngrowth of the delta.In addition, bed incision also occurs\nas the water is sediment-starved.The down-cutting of river-\nbanks can propagate upstream and downstream from the ex-\ntraction sites for many kilometers, in turn affecting river\necosystems over a large area (Kondolf et al., 2018).This bank\nincision results in land loss, which threatens rice growing ar-\neas (Fig.4).Aggressive sand mining also disrupts natural ﬂooding.A\nrecent study of the effects of riverine mining on ﬂood fre-\nquency in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle (LXQ) in the Mekong\nRiver Delta found that ﬂood frequency had dropped by 7.8 %\nfrom 2005–2015.Water levels at local gauge stations also\nshowed an overall decreasing trend, indicating that the low-\nering of the riverbed had reduced the frequency of ﬂooding.Disrupted ﬂood regimes result in reduced volumes of water\nand sediments for agricultural production.In addition, ﬂood-\nwaters typically deposit fertile sediments while ﬂushing the\npesticides and fertilizers accumulated from intensive agricul-\ntural production.When the ﬂood frequency decreases, the\nfrequency at which farmlands beneﬁt from this natural soil\nquality enhancement decreases.Consequently, soil fertility\nmay decrease over time and lead to declines in rice yields un-\nless artiﬁcial fertilizers are added (Park et al., 2020; Fig.4).While there are several studies on the diffuse, yet insidious\nnature of sand mining in the Mekong (cf.Bravard and Gail-\nlot, 2013; Brunier et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2019; Kondolf\net al., 2018; Park et al., 2020; Robert, 2017; Schmitt et al.,\n2017), the extent of sand mining in the Red River Delta isunclear as there is almost no research on this issue.We did\nhowever come across an article in a Vietnamese newspaper\nabout rampant sand mining in the Red River and how min-\ning operations have caused erosion in nearby villages (Chinh,\n2018).Similar to the situation in the MRD, the authorities\nhave turned a blind eye to this illegal business (Bravard and\nGaillot, 2013; Chinh, 2018).3.1.5 Groundwater extraction\nAnother example of an anthropogenic development creating\nother interrelated problems is that of groundwater extraction.']

While the existing literature pre dominantly points the cause of drought to the hydro-\npower dams in the upstream of the Mekong Basin , we contribute new physical evidence of the\nintensi ﬁcation of saline water intrusion (through backwater effect) in the VMD caused by three anthropo-\ngenic drivers: riverbed incision (due to both riverbed m ining and dam construction), sea level rise and land\nsubsidence. Thereupon, we highlight that it is critical to not underestimate the impacts from the localized\nfactors, especially the riverbed-mining which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the\nsalinity intrusion. Our analysis is based on the extensive sets of hourly-to-daily hydrological time series\nfrom 11 gauge stations across the VMD. First, several signs of signi ﬁcantly increased tidal ampliﬁ cation\n(up to 66%) were revealed through the spectral analysi s of the hourly water level data. This trend was fur-\nther validated through the c hanges in slopes of the rating curves at t he tidal zones, implying the relation-\nships between the shift of the backwater effects on the rivers in VMD and the lowered water levelsScience of the Total Environment 757 (2021) 143919\n⁎Corresponding author.\n⁎⁎Correspondence to: E.

What are the major environmental threats to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, and how has the intrusion of saline water affected the region's agriculture and freshwater supply?	The Mekong Delta in Vietnam faces several environmental threats, including the impact of upstream hydropower dams, climate change, and unsustainable sand mining. The construction of dams upstream can alter the hydrodynamics of the region, while climate change can exacerbate issues like flooding and drought. Sand mining can lead to river bank instability, causing further environmental damage.Saline water intrusion is another significant threat to the Mekong Delta. This intrusion is sensitive to sea level rise and changes in river flow. The increased salinity can impact the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping, which is a critical part of the region's agriculture. Furthermore, the intrusion of saline water can reduce the freshwater supply, affecting both the agricultural sector and the availability of drinking water. This has led to a willingness among local farming households to pay for risk reduction measures against salinity intrusion.

in the worst-\ncase scenario, this can be as much as a meter by 2050 ( Erban et al.,\n2014 ).Within the long list of environmental perils that VMD is facing, the\nintrusion of saline water is the main threat towards agriculturalproduction as it salinizes the essential freshwater resources, while\nsimultaneously degrading the soil on its penetration path.Annually, ap-\nproximately 2 million ha of agricultural land are prone to the risks of sa-\nlinity intrusion (SI) ( Smajgl et al., 2015 ;Toan, 2014 ).In addition, the\nintrusion of saline water can disrupt the supply of freshwater for bothdomestic (e.g.household daily use) and industrial consumers, especially\nin the coastal areas.Carew-Reid (2008) remarked that during dry sea-\nsons, strong northwestward winds combined with ﬂood tides and sea\nwater, can penetrate anywhere inland between 40 and 60 km from\nthe estuaries on both east and west coasts of the delta.While these\nnumbers seem signi ﬁcant, they pale in comparison to observations\nfrom the 2016 drought, which is the most severe event over the past90 years ( Kantoush et al., 2017 ).The event affected 12 out of 13 prov-\ninces in VMD (>2 million ha in area); of which were forced to declarea\nstate of natural disaster ( Toan, 2017 ).The total economic loss was es-\ntimated to be around 650 million USD, including 800,000 tons of ricecompletely lost.In addition, the lives of 17 million VMD inhabitants\nwere adversely affected.In 2020, the VMD experienced yet another cat-\nastrophic drought which possibly surpasses any historical records, in-\ncluding the ones observed in 2016 (From the local news: https://vtv.vn)."", 'Kantoush, S., Binh, D.V., Sumi, T., Trung, L.V., 2017.Impact of upstream hydropower dams\nand climate change on hydrodynamics of Vietnamese Mekong Delta.Journal of Japan\nSociety of Civil Engineers.Ser.B1 (Hydraulic Engineering) 73, 109 –114.Khang, N.D., Kotera, A., Sakamoto, T., Yokozawa, M., 2008.Sensitivity of salinity intrusion\nto sea level rise and river ﬂow change in Vietnamese Mekong Delta-impacts on avail-\nability of irrigation water for rice cropping.Journal of Agricultural Meteorology 64\n(3), 167 –176.Khong, T.D., Young, M.D., Loch, A., Thennakoon, J., 2018.Mekong River Delta farm-\nhousehold willingness to pay for salinity intrusion risk reduction.Agric.WaterManag.200, 80 –89.Kingdom of the Netherlands and The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2013.Mekong Delta\nPlan.Report.Kuenzer, C., Renaud, F.G., 2012.Climate and environmental change in river deltas glob-\nally: expected impacts, resilience, and adaptation.The Mekong Delta System.Springer, Dordrecht, pp.7 –46.Li, X., Liu, J.P., Saito, Y., Nguyen, V.L., 2017.Recent evolution of the Mekong Delta and the\nimpacts of dams.Earth Sci.Rev.175, 1 –17.Lima, I.B.T., Rosa, R.R., Ramos, F.M., de Moraes Novo, E.M.L., 2003.Water level dynamics in\nthe Amazon ﬂoodplain.Adv.Water Resour.26 (7), 725 –732.Loc, H.H., Diep, N.T.H., Can, N.T., Irvine, K.N., Shimizu, Y., 2017.Integrated evaluation of\necosystem services in prawn-rice rotational crops, Vietnam.Ecosystem services 26,\n377 –387.Loc, H.H., Irvine, K.N., Diep, N.T.H., Quyen, N.T.K., Tue, N.N., Shimizu, Y., 2018.The legal as-\npects of Ecosystem Services in agricultural land pricing, some implications from a\ncase study in Vietnam ’s Mekong Delta.Ecosystem Services 29, 360 –369.Loc, H.H., Irvine, K.N., Suwanarit, A., Vallikul, P., Likitswat, F., Sahavacharin, A., Sovann, C.,\n2020a.Mainstreaming ecosystem services as public policy in South East Asia, from\ntheory to practice.Sustainability and Law.Springer, Cham, pp.631 –665.Loc, H.H., Park, E., Chitwatkulsiri, D., Lim, J., Yun, S.H., Maneechot, L., 2020b.Local rainfall\nor river over ﬂow?Re-evaluating the cause of the Great 2011 Thailand ﬂood.J.

What methods were used to investigate the changes in backwater effects and salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how were these methods applied to different time periods and locations?	The investigation into the changes in backwater effects and salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta was conducted using extensive sets of hourly-to-daily hydrological time series from 11 gauge stations across the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). The researchers first identified signs of significantly increased tidal amplification (up to 66%) through spectral analysis of the hourly water level data. This trend was further validated through changes in slopes of the rating curves at the tidal zones, which implied the relationships between the shift of the backwater effects on the rivers in VMD and the lowered water levels. This approach allowed the researchers to assess the impact of various anthropogenic drivers, such as riverbed incision due to riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence, on the intensification of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta.

What are the impacts of dams and riverbed incision on the dry season water levels in the Mekong Delta, and how does this affect saline water intrusion in the region?	The construction of upstream hydropower dams has significantly altered the hydro-sedimentary regimes of the Mekong River. This, combined with the sea level rise, has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's shorelines. Internally in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), there has been a constant decrease of flood frequency over the past two decades due to sand mining and dike construction. Extensive mining in the lower reach of the river has also led to significant geomorphic impacts such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank erosion. These changes have contributed to the intrusion of saline water, which is a major threat to agricultural production as it salinizes the essential freshwater resources and degrades the soil. Annually, approximately 2 million hectares of agricultural land are prone to the risks of salinity intrusion. In addition, the intrusion of saline water can disrupt the supply of freshwater for both domestic and industrial consumers, especially in the coastal areas.

What are the factors contributing to the increased trends of saline water intrusion across the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	The intensification of saline water intrusion across the Mekong Delta in Vietnam is caused by three main anthropogenic drivers. These include riverbed incision, which is a result of riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence. Among these, riverbed mining is particularly significant as it can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year, thereby amplifying the salinity intrusion.

Based on the report, how has the increase in sand mining activities around My Thuan station affected the tidal amplitudes and water levels in the Tien river?	The increase in sand mining activities around My Thuan station, which is significantly higher than that around Dai Ngai, has led to greater drops in the water levels of the Tien river. This has resulted in stronger bidirectional water exchange and an intensification of tidal signals. Specifically, the 12-hour frequency tidal amplitude at My Thuan had increased by 66%, which is considerably higher than the 20% increase observed at the coastal station, Dai Ngai.	"[""incision volume in 2014 –2017 from Tan Chau to My Thuan in the Tien\nRiver (52.5 Mm3/year) was nearly three times greater than that in\n1998 –2008 in the entire Tien and Hau Rivers (20 Mm3/year). They\nclaimed that the increased riverbed incision was caused by upstream\ndams (85%) and sand mining (15%). The increasing riverbed incision be-\ntween 1998 and 2008 and 2014 –2017 periods were consistent with the\nrapidly decreased water level at Tan Chau and Chau Doc in post-2011\ncompared to pre-2011 ( Fig. 2 A–B). Additionally, increasing riverbank\nerosion ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Jordan et al., 2019 ) may contribute to\nwater level reduction at riverine stations because of the expansion of\nthe cross-sectional area.\nOn the other hand, the mean annual water levels (calculated from\nthe hourly water level data) at three tidal stations along the coastline:\nBen Trai, My Thanh, and Binh Dai all presented signi ﬁcant increasing\ntrends since the 1990s ( p-value < 0.001) ( Fig. 2 D–F). In particular, the\nmean annual water levels at Ben Trai, My Thanh, and Binh Dai had re-\nspectively increased by approximately 0.072, 0,22 and 0.25 m during\nthe 20-year period from 1990 to 2010. This directly shows the amplify-\ning trend of SLR around VMD which is in line with the ﬁnding by Nhan\n(2016) . The increasing trends of SI across VMD are therefore attributed\nto the combined effects of decreased riverine water levels and increased\ntidal effects. In the following subsections, we further investigate how\nﬂuvial and tidal regimes have shifted in recent decades by analyzing\nthe power spectrum of the water level series.3.2. Ampli ﬁcation of tidal signals\n3.2.1. Power spectral analysis of the tidal effects\nThe estuaries of the Tien and Hau rivers are dominated by semi-\ndiurnal tides which have two troughs and two peaks daily (12- and24-hour oscillations in Fig. 3 A–F). On a monthly basis, the spring tide\nand neap tide, each occurs twice a month (half-month and one-month\noscillations in Fig. 3 A–F). Under pristine condition, these temporal fre-\nquencies and the respective amplitudes of the tidal regime should stayalmost unchanged. However, the results from our power spectral anal-\nysis show otherwise. More speci ﬁcally, the amplitudes of almost every\nspectral peak of the monthly tidal cycles had increased signi ﬁcantly\nafter 2000 periods at all river stations in our analysis ( Fig. 3 G–H). We\nspeculate that these unusual increases of the spectral peaks couldhave been attributed to the following: the increased tidal amplitude\n(in the continental shelf due to SLR) ( Nhan, 2016 ), drops in water levels\n(related to the riverbed mining and upstream dams) ( Park et al., 2020a ;\nPark et al., 2020b ), and LS ( Erban et al., 2014 ;Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).\nTable 2 further quanti ﬁes the shifts in the power spectral peaks at all\nthree analyzed stations. More speci ﬁcally, the power spectral density of\ntheﬂuvial oscillation (1 year monsoonal-seasonality) has decreased the\nmost at Hoa Binh (from 3.8 dB to −10.6 dB), followed by My Thuan\n(from−11\ndB to −12.5 dB) and Dai Ngai (from −11.1 dB to\n−11.6 dB). As the tidal regime interacts with the Mekong River's\nFig. 3. Tidal power spectrum analysis for three representative stations: My Thuan (A, B, G); Hoa Binh (C, D, H); and Dai Ngai (E, F, I).

How has the increase in riverbed incision and reduction in river-sea gradient contributed to the intensification of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta over time?	The increase in riverbed incision and reduction in river-sea gradient have contributed to the intensification of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta by altering the balance between fresh and saline water. The incision of the riverbed, often due to activities like extensive mining, reduces the gradient between the river and the sea, making it easier for saline water to intrude upstream. This is further exacerbated by factors such as sea level rise, land subsidence, and the operation of upstream dams which modify the hydro-sedimentary regimes of the river. These factors collectively contribute to the retreat of the Delta's shorelines and the intrusion of saline water into freshwater resources, posing a significant threat to agricultural production and freshwater supply.	"[""Sea level rise\nDam constructioncaused by the riverbed incision.Finally, we introduc e a novel approach using the annual incision rates of the\nriverbed to compare four SI driving factors in terms of t heir relative contributions to the balance between\nfresh and saline water in the VMD.©2 0 2 0E l s e v i e rB .V .A l lr i g h t sr e s e r v e d .1.Introduction\nThe Mekong River originates from the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau, runs\nacross China and ﬁve other countries, and forms the Vietnamese Me-\nkong Delta (VMD) at the downstream course before draining into the\nEast Sea.With a total area of more than 4 million ha, VMD houses 17\nmillion people and accounts for half of the country's food supplies.With the current productivity of ~25 million tons of rice every year,\nVMD not only safeguards the country's food security but also contrib-\nutes about 18.7% of the national GDP through agricultural products ex-\nports ( Dung et al., 2019 ;Eslami et al., 2019 ;GSO, 2016 ;Piesse, 2019 ).The sustainable development of this important food basket, however,is under several internal and external environmental pressures (e.g.Arias et al., 2019 ;Trung and Thanh, 2013 ;Triet et al., 2017 ).Upstream,\nthere is the looming threat from the accelerated construction of hydro-power dams which have drastically modiﬁ ed the hydro-sedimentary\nregimes of the river (e.g.Anthony et al., 2015 ;Dinh et al., 2012 ;\nEslami et al., 2019 ;Van et al., 2012 ;Yang et al., 2019 ).Operation of\nthese dam reservoirs, combined with the downstream sea level rise(SLR) has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's\nshorelines ( Li et al., 2017 ).Internally in VMD, Park et al.(2020a) re-\nported on the constant decrease of ﬂood frequency over the past two\ndecades due to sand mining and dike construction in both the wet and\ndry seasons (1995 –2015).Several authors, including Brunier et al.(2014) ;Hackney et al.(2020) ;a n d Binh et al.(2020b) have also re-\nported signi ﬁcant geomorphic impacts due to extensive mining in the\nlower reach of the river such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank ero-\nsion.Likewise, due to the groundwater extraction, VMD is currently\nexperiencing land subsidence (LS) at an alarming rate; in the worst-\ncase scenario, this can be as much as a meter by 2050 ( Erban et al.,\n2014 ).Within the long list of environmental perils that VMD is facing, the\nintrusion of saline water is the main threat towards agriculturalproduction as it salinizes the essential freshwater resources, while\nsimultaneously degrading the soil on its penetration path.Annually, ap-\nproximately 2 million ha of agricultural land are prone to the risks of sa-\nlinity intrusion (SI) ( Smajgl et al., 2015 ;Toan, 2014 ).In addition, the\nintrusion of saline water can disrupt the supply of freshwater for bothdomestic (e.g.household daily use) and industrial consumers, especially\nin the coastal areas.Carew-Reid (2008) remarked that during dry sea-\nsons, strong northwestward winds combined with ﬂood tides and sea\nwater, can penetrate anywhere inland between 40 and 60 km from\nthe estuaries on both east and west coasts of the delta.While these\nnumbers seem signi ﬁcant, they pale in comparison to observations\nfrom the 2016 drought, which is the most severe event over the past90 years ( Kantoush et al., 2017 ).The event affected 12 out of 13 prov-\ninces in VMD (>2 million ha in area); of which were forced to declarea\nstate of natural disaster ( Toan, 2017 ).The total economic loss was es-\ntimated to be around 650 million USD, including 800,000 tons of ricecompletely lost.In addition, the lives of 17 million VMD inhabitants\nwere adversely affected.In 2020, the VMD experienced yet another cat-\nastrophic drought which possibly surpasses any historical records, in-\ncluding the ones observed in 2016 (From the local news: https://vtv.vn)."", ""In this regard, reductions in the discharge of the Mekong River and cli-\nmate change-induced SLR are attributed as major causes of SI increment\nin the VMD ( Khang et al., 2008 ;Mai et al., 2018a, 2018b ;Toan, 2014 ;Vu\net al., 2018 ).Comparing to the baseline in 2000, if sea level rises by\n25–30 cm in 2050, SI length and salinity concentration will increase\nby 10 km and 0.5 –2.5 g/l in places 15 km from the sea ( Vu et al.,\n2018 ).Khong et al.(2018) estimated that the salinity isoline of 2.5 g/l\nis likely to intrude further up-river by 10 km in the main rivers and by20 km in the paddy ﬁeld if there is a combined effect of 20 cm SLR\nand 15% discharge reduction of the Mekong River in the mid-2030s.The respective numbers would be 20 km and 35 km if SLR of 45 cm com-\nbines with 29% discharge reduction of the Mekong River in the mid-2090s.Toan (2014) estimated that saline water will intrude further\nup-river by 20 km and 27 km in the Tien and Hau Rivers, respectively,if sea level rises by 1 m. In a different manner, Mai et al.(2018a) exam-\nined what would happen if there was no emergency water release fromdams in the 2015 –2016 drought event.They revealed that salinity con-\ncentration in places 30 km from the sea will increase by 14 –23% if the\ndischarge entering the VMD decreases by 364 m\n3/s from March 27 to\nApril 27, 2016.The value will be 35 –51% if such discharge reduction\ncombines with a 3.36 cm SLR.In this combined scenario, the SI lengthmay increase by 16 –24 km in the mainstream.Another important driver\nof the recently enhanced SI in the VMD is the increasing construction ofhydraulic structures in the estuaries (i.e.salinity control sluice gates\nalong the main rivers).Surprisingly, the purpose of these hydraulic\nstructures is to control SI but Binh et al.(2020c) numerically found\nthat the construction of salinity control sluice gates along Tien andHau Rivers may enhance the length of SI up-river because of reducing\nbuffering zones near the estuaries.4.Management outlooks and policy implications\n4.1.The need to decouple the contributing factors to the SI: a budgetary\napproach\nThe results presented above have clari ﬁed how the dynamics of\nwater level balance between river and coastal can control the level ofSI in the VMD.The tug of war between salt and freshwater is deter-\nmined by a combined effect of riverbed mining, upstream hydropower\ndams, SLR, and LS.These drivers are recognized at different geographical\nscales; likewise, their respective countermeasures.For instance, while\nriverbed mining or LS can be entirely managed domestically, the opera-\ntion of the upstream dams can only be negotiated via transnational dip-\nlomatic measures.It is therefore critical to understand the roles of each\ndriver to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, hence effectively prioritizing the coun-\ntermeasures.In addition, the limited ﬁnancial and technical resources of\na developing country such as Vietnam critically urge the need to rankthe relative importance of the drivers to plan the mitigation strategies\naccordingly.In fact, a synthesized appreciation of the Mekong River\nbasin from the geomorphology and sedimentary perspectives, such as\nin the neighboring Chao Phraya basin (e.g.Park et al., 2020b ) is impor-\ntant, yet essentially lacking.Besides, the current understanding of SI in the VMD has been the-\nmatically fragmented so far, including for instance, tidal ampli ﬁcations\n(Eslami et al., 2019 ), riverbed mining and bank erosion ( Hackney\net al., 2020 ), or LS ( Minderhoud et al., 2017, 2018 ).The imbalance\ncould have been related to each research teams' technical backgrounds\nand expertise but mainly due to the challenge to separate the com-\npound effects on SI from different pressures.""]"
What are the projected impacts of sea level rise and reduced Mekong River discharge on salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how might this affect my farming activities in the region?	The projected impacts of sea level rise and reduced Mekong River discharge could intensify the intrusion of saline water into the Mekong Delta. This salinity intrusion could have significant effects on farming activities in the region. For instance, it could salinize the essential freshwater resources used for irrigation, while also degrading the soil on its penetration path. This could potentially render approximately 2 million hectares of agricultural land prone to the risks of salinity intrusion annually. During severe droughts, the effects could be even more devastating, as observed in the 2016 drought, which affected 12 out of 13 provinces in the Mekong Delta, causing significant economic losses including 800,000 tons of rice completely lost. Therefore, if you are farming in this region, these changes could significantly affect your crop yields and overall agricultural productivity.

"""What is the method proposed in the report to estimate the level of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how does it relate to riverbed mining and upstream dams?"""	The report introduces a conceptual approach to estimate the relative contributions to saline intrusion from upstream hydropower dams and riverbed mining. It suggests that the incision rates (IRs) caused by these factors could vary significantly. The IRs associated with the reach of the Mekong with the highest riverbed mining risks are speculated to range from 15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year. The report acknowledges that the estimation of IRs from riverbed mining might be underestimated due to the generalization of the IR across the Mekong Delta and the crude characterization of bathymetry, which is based on extrapolation of single beam echosounder data. Advanced bathymetry survey methods like multibeam echosounder could provide more accurate estimations, but they are not feasible in terms of time and cost. Despite these limitations, the proposed method could lay important groundwork for future research.	"[""exclusively associated with the reach of the Mekong with the highest\nriverbed mining risks, i.e.Tan Chau to My Thuan.Accordingly, we spec-\nulated that the IR caused from dams would also vary, ranging from\n15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020b ).For SLR and LS, we refer to the previously published results, respectivelyreporting the IRs of 1.5 –2 cm/year and 0.82 cm/year ( Eslami et al., 2019 ;\nMinderhoud et al., 2017 ).Among the estimated IRs, we consider that\nthe riverbed mining is the most likely to be underestimated.This isdue to the generalization of the IR across the VMD using the values\ndriven from local-scale survey, and the crude characterization of ba-\nthymetry in the VMD, which is based on extrapolation of the single\nbeam echosounder ( Binh et al., 2020b ).Admittedly, advanced bathym-\netry survey methods such as multibeam echosounder (MBES) mighthave resulted in more accurate estimations of riverbend incision rates.However, covering the world's third largest delta using MBES would\nnot be feasible in terms of time and cost.Plus, given the absence of\nother viable alternatives, what we propose here could lay an important\ngroundwork that can inspire following up research for improvements\nfrom the relevant scienti ﬁc community.The resulting IRs, estimation\nmethods, and the key references are summarized in Table 3 .4.2.Policy outlooks - the need for both integrated and adaptive approaches\n4.2.1.Evidence-based priority of countermeasures\nAccording to our initial assessment on IRs presented in Table 3 ,t h e\nupstream dams have the most signi ﬁcant impact, followed by the river-\nbed mining, SLR and LS, constituting an evidence-based priority for\ndealing with the SI intensifying drivers.However, the major discrepan-\ncies in politics, philosophies and economic interests among the coun-\ntries sharing the Mekong River water resources ( Kansal et al., 2019 )\nwould make negotiating over the hydropower dams with the upstreamcountries an uphill battle for the Vietnam government.In contrast, the\nthree domestic issues should be more immediately manageable with\nregulatory and enforcement measures at different administration levels.Accordingly, with a speci ﬁc consideration of the three domestic pres-\nsures contributing to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, riverbed mining has the\nhighest IRs and substantially higher than those of SLR and LS.It is there-\nfore underlined that mitigating the intrusion of saline water in the VMD\nshould ﬁrst work on strategies to slow down the IR contributing from\nriverbed mining by controlling the sediment excavation volumes.Thiscall for bold, nation-wide actions to decisively control the exports of\nthe riverbed sediments while raising the disciplinary actions against il-\nlegal mining to effectively halt the sinking rate of the delta and safe-\nguard the livelihood of millions of inhabitants.4.2.2.Encouraging eco-based livelihoods for better adaptations\nLivelihood adaptation to salinity intrusion is another key aspect for\npolicy reforms.Our study has indicated how the saline water protrudes\nfurther inland and on a more frequent basis.Other studies have already\nshown how SI and other environmental pressures put millions of inhab-\nitants at critical risks ( Park et al., 2020a ;Park et al., 2020b ;Tamura et al.,\n2020 ;Loc et al., 2020a, 2020b ;Pham et al., 2020 ).Active adaptation to\nsalinity intrusion and living with salinity has also been put on the policy\nagenda with the Mekong Delta Plan (2013) , Resolution 120 in 2017.Moreover, agricultural models are increasingly adopted that thrive onsalinity intrusion.Basically, there are two options.Either farmersadapt their cropping to the wet-dry seasonality and grow a brackish\ncrop during the dry season ( Loc et al., 2017, 2018, 2020a, 2020b ;Tan\net al., 2020 ;Pham et al., 2020 ).The rice-shrimp system is well adapted\nto the regular rain-dry season spell, where a decent crop of rice can be\nharvested during the wet season, followed by the raising of an extensivecrop\nof shrimp."", 'Therefore, this scope of this paper expands into intro-\nducing a conceptual approach to estimate the relative contributions\nto SI from upstream hydropower dams and riverbed mining.Finally,\nbased on the novel biophysical evidence presented, we recommend\npotential measures for the VMD policy makers to deal with the\never-intensifying intrusion of saline water, incorporating both tech-n i c a la n dp o l i t i c a la s p e c t s .H.H.Loc, D.

What are the main drivers of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta and what strategies are suggested to mitigate this issue?	The main drivers of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta are riverbed incision, which is due to both riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence. The paper suggests that political reform is a recommended strategy to mitigate this issue, based on the new findings. It also emphasizes the importance of not underestimating the impacts from localized factors, especially riverbed-mining which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the salinity intrusion.

What are some alternative crops or farming practices that could be adopted in areas of the Mekong Delta that are exposed to year-round saline water intrusion?	Farmers in areas of the Mekong Delta exposed to year-round saline water intrusion could consider growing short-season vegetable crops that require limited fresh water, such as beans, spinach, and onions. They could also explore salt-tolerant fruticulture, such as coconut and pineapple, or brackish aquaculture, which would require supporting water infrastructure like separate intake-outtake channels, daily refreshing, use of biofilters, and no groundwater pumping. Another promising alternative is the ecosystem-based model of mangrove-shrimp farming, which involves community involvement and technical support for farmers to cultivate economically valued black tiger giant shrimp in mangrove forests. This model also encourages farmers to protect mangrove forests, which in turn safeguard against storm surges.	['Instead of shrimp, farmers could grow a short-season\nvegetable crop that can be grown with the limited fresh water available,\nsuch as beans, spinach, and onions.Another option worth exploring is the salt-tolerant fruticulture (e.g.coconut, pineapple) or brackish aquaculture that is supported with\nwater infrastructure (e.g.separate intake-outtake channels, daily\nrefreshing, use of bio ﬁlters, no groundwater pumping).This is particu-\nlarly important for those areas with year-round exposure to salinewater.Finally, an ecosystem-based model that has shown various\npromising merits while being adopted to the SI prone coastal areas is\nthe mangrove-shrimp ( Nguyen et al., 2020a ).This ecosystem-based\nmodel was built upon the community involvement whereby thefarmers are supported both in terms of ﬁnance and technical know-\nhows to cultivate economically valued (the black tiger giant shrimp)in the mangrove forests.Thereupon, the farmers proactively protect\nthe mangrove forests as their own properties, which in turn, safeguards\nanother important ecosystem service being the protection from storm\nsurges.4.2.3.Transboundary water diplomacy\nEven though the upstream dams pose the most challenging barrier\nto the SI that the VMD currently faces, there are potential pathways to\novercome.The key focus is how to effectively negotiate the co-shared\nwater resources with the competing upstream users, those whose ben-\neﬁts are directly/indirectly related to the hydropower dams.Theoreti-\ncally, this can be done via multinational diplomatic platforms namely,\nthe Mekong River Commission (MRC), the Greater Mekong Subregion\n(GMS) Program, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).However, they have not been as productive as intended due to multiple\ndiscrepancies between the member countries in terms of political/eco-\nnomic interests ( Kansal et al., 2019 ).Plus, not all geographically related\ncountries are keen on multilateral dialogues, instead, they opt for bilat-eral diplomacies, making the unanimity in sharing the resources within\nthe Mekong River Basin even harder to achieve ( Kuenzer and Renaud,\n2012 ).Nevertheless, it is strongly emphasized that the issues of the up-\nstream dams should be constantly discussed at regional and interna-\ntional forums so that the negative impacts of these structures on the\nbasin environment, including the intensi ﬁed salinity can be widely ac-\nknowledged.In doing so, the VMD stakeholders can generate supportfrom the international community, essential for the transboundary\nwater diplomacy plan.5.Conclusions\nThis paper advances the current understanding of SI in the VMD,\nhighlighting the signi ﬁcant recent shifts of the BWE imposed on the riv-\ners.This BWE is driven by four main environmental pressures: riverbed\nincision due to riverbed mining and dam construction, SLR and LS.Our\nanalysis is based on the extensive data sets of hydrological time series\nfrom 11 gauge stations across the VMD, along with ﬁeld survey bathym-\netry data.Table 3\nRiverbed incision rates (IRs) from different drivers.Rank Drivers Rate (cm/year) Estimation method References\n1 Upstream dams 15.6 –45.6 IRtotal−IRriverbed mining Brunier et al.(2014)Binh et al.(2020b)\n2 Riverbed mining 4.4 –15 V\nmined / Area water surface Jordan et al.(2019)Erban et al.(2014)\n3 Sea level rise 1.5 –2 Literature Eslami et al.(2019)\n4 Land subsidence 0–0.82 Literature Minderhoud et al.(2017)H.H.Loc, D.

What are the main drivers of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how do they contribute to the increasing trend of saline water intrusion?	The main drivers of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta are riverbed incision, sea level rise, and land subsidence. Riverbed incision, which is caused by both riverbed mining and dam construction, is identified as the primary driver. Riverbed mining, in particular, can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year, significantly amplifying the salinity intrusion. Sea level rise and land subsidence are also contributing factors. These anthropogenic drivers have led to an intensification of saline water intrusion through a phenomenon known as the backwater effect. This effect is evidenced by increased tidal amplification and lowered water levels in the region.

What are the potential impacts of upstream hydropower dams and climate change on the hydrodynamics of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and its effect on rice cropping?	Upstream hydropower dams and climate change can significantly impact the hydrodynamics of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. These changes can increase the sensitivity of salinity intrusion to sea level rise and river flow changes. This can have detrimental impacts on the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping, as increased salinity can harm the crops. Furthermore, the operation of dams and sea level rise can exacerbate saltwater intrusion into the Mekong Delta. The development of cascade hydropower can also intensify salinity intrusion.

Based on the report, how has overexploitation of groundwater from deep aquifers in the Mekong Delta affected the environment and contributed to the salinization and freshening of water resources in the region?	Overexploitation of groundwater in the Mekong Delta has led to numerous negative environmental impacts. One of the most significant impacts is the decrease of hydraulic heads, which increases the potential for seawater intrusion. This intrusion can substantially degrade the quality of groundwater, limiting its use and potentially affecting human health. Additionally, heavy groundwater extraction has resulted in severe local land subsidence of several centimeters per year. This is caused by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, which leads to irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with other processes, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. The area is also facing issues such as natural compaction of sediment layers, a decline in fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change. In some parts, heavy coastal and riverbank erosion is also observed. These problems collectively contribute to a progressive loss of land and freshwater, which could eventually lead to the inundation of large parts of the delta.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What are the potential impacts of groundwater overexploitation, such as the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, on the quality of groundwater and human health in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Overexploitation of groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, can lead to a decrease in hydraulic heads and the potential for seawater intrusion. These changes can substantially degrade the quality of groundwater, making it less suitable for use. This degradation can also negatively impact human health. Furthermore, the overexploitation can cause local land subsidence, or sinking, of several centimeters per year due to decreased pore pressure from pumping. This results in the irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. The combination of these issues, along with other factors like natural compaction of sediment layers, decline of fluvial sediment supply, salinization of surface water, sea-level rise, and weather extremes, can lead to a progressive loss of land and freshwater. This could eventually result in the inundation of large parts of the delta.

What are the potential impacts of direct seawater intrusion on the groundwater system in the Ca Mau Peninsula, the southernmost province in Vietnam, and how might it affect the salinization rates in the region?	Direct seawater intrusion into the groundwater system in the Ca Mau Peninsula can lead to a substantial degradation of groundwater quality and limit its use. This could also affect human health. The salinization rates in the region could increase due to the intrusion of seawater, which would further degrade the quality of the groundwater. Additionally, the overexploitation of groundwater can lead to environmental impacts such as the decrease of hydraulic heads, which can increase the potential for seawater intrusion. This, in turn, can exacerbate the salinization process.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What is the significance of the average thickness of each aquifer in the Miocene aquifer n13 and how does it relate to groundwater resources in the context of climate change?	The context does not provide specific information on the significance of the average thickness of each aquifer in the Miocene aquifer n13 and how it relates to groundwater resources in the context of climate change.	['Average thickness \ncalculated by interpolating down to the Miocene aquifer n13 (chapter 2.2.4).Each aquifer is overlain by the corresponding aquitard (not included \nhere).Ages after Cohen et al.(2013) .The lower boundary from n13 is estimated after Wagner et al.(2012) .J. Bauer et al.', 'Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n7then stacked (Turner, 2006 ).This approach is common in sedimentary environments and is widely used for groundwater mapping \n(Natali et al., 2012 ).Subsurface modelling was conducted using MATLAB 2020b (MathWorks Inc.).Top and bottom boundaries from \n14 layers recorded in 27 boreholes were used as 3-D scattered input data.While almost all boreholes reach aquifer qp1, except one, the number of boreholes reaching deeper layers are gradually decreasing \nwith only seven reaching aquifer n21 and only one the aquitard beneath.As this is a typical phenomenon in lithological data acquisition \n(Turner, 2006 ), all boreholes were vertically interpolated down to the Miocene aquifer n13 based on mean layer thickness from the \navailable data.No information from outside the study area was used because depth and thickness of stratigraphic units significantly \nvary throughout the delta (Nguyen et al., 2000 ) and might have therefore distorted the calculation.For the model, a 2-D grid was \ncreated with a 100m resolution in latitude and longitude direction using the meshgrid command, and for each layer a 3-D data \ninterpolation was done using triangulation-based natural neighbor method with griddata , which was then visualized using the mesh \ncommand.It should be noted that the quality of the provided borehole logs could not be further evaluated here and thus no extensive \nmodel validation was conducted.Based on the straightforward model approach, the model does not consider discontinues clay lenses \nwithin aquifers (Erban et al., 2013 ) and other potential small-scale characteristics, such as paleo channels as well as areas of \nnon-deposition and areas of erosion (Turner, 2006 ).Groundwater samples were plotted in this subsurface model to enable a sample to aquifer assignment.In order to account for a thin \naquitard between aquifer qp2–3 and qp1 and to account for possible aforementioned uncertainties in the interpolation, it was only \ndistinguished between Pleistocene and Pliocene samples.Samples outside of the convex hull were correlated with the nearest borehole \nand assigned to the respective aquifer.In addition, a 71.5 km long geological cross section was drawn through the model area.Samples, larger cities and monitoring wells within a 10km perpendicular distance to the profile were included.Location of monitoring \nwells and the course of the cross section are displayed in Fig.2.Most monitoring wells accumulate around CMC.Extrapolation outside \nthe convex hull of the available borehole data was avoided intentionally to assure a more valid model within the verifiable boundaries.Therefore, the cross-section was not extrapolated to the sea.3.Results \n3.1.Water geochemistry \nMajor geochemical water parameters are listed in Table 2.EC values range between 571 µS/cm and 5180 µS/cm.21 samples have \nEC between 2500 and 3850 µS/cm while two samples in the northwest have EC around 5000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).A mean conversion factor \nfor EC to TDS of 0.81 was calculated.Note that this factor deviates from 0.67, which is commonly used by NAWAPI.As this conversion \nfactor is highly depended on ionic water composition the conversion factor presented here is more accurate for the study area and \nshould be considered for future water use guidelines.Na+is the dominant cation in the majority of samples in CMP.The Piper Diagram in Fig.4 shows that Na-Cl, Na-HCO 3 and mixed \nwater types occur in Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers.Pliocene samples are depleted in Ca2++Mg2+and contain over 70% Na+, while \nsome Pleistocene samples contain more divalent cations, especially those with high EC and a higher proportion of Cl-.Sulfate only \nplays a minor role in the water composition, is mostly below 10% and never exceeds 25%.The spatial distribution of the detailed water \ntype (see chapter 2.2.2) is presented in Fig.3.In this classification the dominant water type is Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl).Only eleven \nsamples are solely dominated by Cl-.It is striking that these samples of Na-Cl type, shown in red, are randomly distributed in CMP.Two \nsamples in the north of CMP are of Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-(Na)-HCO 3 type, colored in blue.']
How has the rising sea levels and sedimentation after the Last Glacial Maximum affected the distribution of saline and fresh groundwater in the Mekong Delta?	The rising sea levels and sedimentation after the Last Glacial Maximum have significantly affected the distribution of saline and fresh groundwater in the Mekong Delta. Overexploitation of groundwater has led to various negative environmental impacts, including the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion. This can substantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and affect human health. Additionally, severe local land subsidence, induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, along with natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, a decline of fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change, threatens the low-lying Mekong Delta. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise. The problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land and freshwater”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What factors are considered to influence the present geochemical composition of groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	The present geochemical composition of groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam is influenced by factors such as the initiation of the Mekong River delta, sea-level changes, anthropogenic drivers of relative sea-level rise, the hydrogeological situation in the region, deep ground-water investigation methods, paleo-hydrogeological reconstruction of the fresh-saline groundwater distribution, trends in long-term drought changes, and salinization in large river deltas. Other factors include the release of arsenic to deep groundwater linked to pumping-induced land subsidence, groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sea-level rise, as well as the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to groundwater use and climate change.

What methods were used to determine the salinity levels and distribution of groundwater in the Mekong Delta, and what were the findings regarding the distribution of fresh and saline groundwater?	Several methods were used to determine the salinity levels and distribution of groundwater in the Mekong Delta. For instance, the combined VES/MTS Methods were used for deep ground-water investigation near Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Geochemical modeling was also used for the interpretation of water analyses. In terms of findings, a paleo-hydrogeological reconstruction of the fresh-saline groundwater distribution in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta since the late Pleistocene was conducted. Additionally, the 3D groundwater salinity distribution and fresh groundwater volumes in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, were inferred from geostatistical analyses. However, the context does not provide specific findings regarding the distribution of fresh and saline groundwater.

What is the significance of molar ion ratios in distinguishing between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers, and how does this relate to the salinization of a freshwater aquifer by seawater intrusion?	Molar ion ratios, specifically Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl- and Mg2+/Cl- ratios, are useful tools for distinguishing between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. In the early stages of salinization, where a freshwater aquifer is being intruded by seawater, the fresh Ca2+-dominated groundwater becomes enriched in Na+ and Mg2+. This is due to divalent cations being exchanged on the mineral surface preferentially to monovalent cations. However, as salinization intensifies, this ion selectivity is masked by the proportional increase in sorption with increasing concentration, especially of the monovalent ion Na+. This leads to Na+ exchanging divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ from sedimentary rocks, forming Ca-Cl and Na-Mg-Cl waters, and increasing overall salinity. In this process, the Na+/Cl- ratio decreases below the conservative mixing line. Conversely, during freshening, or when freshwater inflows into saline coastal aquifers, the cation-exchange reaction is reversed. Freshwater of Ca-HCO3 type intrudes the saline aquifer and exchangeable Na+ on mineral surfaces is substituted by Ca2+ and Mg2+, leading to a change in water type to the characteristic Na-HCO3. This results in an increase in the Na+/Cl- ratio above the level of seawater. Therefore, the changes in these molar ion ratios can provide valuable insights into the processes of salinization and freshening in coastal aquifers.	['However, especially in redox-sensitive \nmarine and coastal settings, the difference between total alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity may not be neglected due to the \nimpact of other buffering bases such as B(OH) 4-, NH3, Si(OH) 3 O-, or F- (Lukawska-Matuszewska, 2016 ).The conversion factor for EC to TDS is highly depended on ionic water composition and may differ from the instrument value, \nwhich is typically calibrated by KCl solution (Vengosh, 2013 ).Therefore, TDS was calculated for each sample using the software \nGeochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC) with the whole elemental composition as input data.Furthermore, the \ndirect relationship between all parameters was calculated using pairwise Spearman correlation.The calcium carbonate system in coastal groundwater settings is complex, and many processes actually lead to carbonate disso -\nlution with subsequent increase in HCO 3- and Ca2+(Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).In saline aquifers, mixing of calcium carbonate \nsaturated fresh groundwater with seawater, which is typically oversaturated, produces brackish water which is undersaturated with \nregard to calcium carbonate due to the reduction in ionic strength, leading to calcite dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).The saturation indices for calcite (SIcalcite) were calculated using Geochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC).Furthermore, SI of additional evaporites including aragonite, dolomite, gypsum, sylvite and halite were calculated.The proportion of major cations Na++K+, Ca2+and Mg2+and anions HCO 3-, Cl- and SO42- were calculated and displayed in a Piper \nDiagram (Piper, 1944 ).The water type can be derived from the upper diamond shape (Back and Hanshaw, 1965 ).Water type analysis \ncan help to distinguish geochemical processes and to derive the origin of solutes.However, divisions and percentages used for clas-\nsification should be selected as to best fit the characteristics of the investigated water (Freeze and Cherry, 1979 ).Therefore, to achieve \na more detailed water type specification and to get more insights on mixed water types, the typical description was customized in order \nto more accurately display different states of salinization with an emphasis on cation-exchange processes.Proportions of major ions \nwere calculated and if only one cation or anion was above 33.3%, it is written alone, like Na-Cl water type, while if two ions were above \n33.3%, the ion with the higher proportion was written first, followed by the second ion in brackets, for example Na-Cl-(HCO 3).A mixed \nwater type is thus only defined if all three anions or cations have an equal share of around 33.3%, e.g.Na-Ca-Mg-Cl is written as Mix-Cl.2.2.3.Salinization and freshening \nThe evaluation of molar ion ratios is an appropriate tool to distinguish between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal \naquifers (Appelo, 1994; Jones et al., 1999; Russak et al., 2016 ).Therefore, Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl- and Mg2+/Cl- molar ratios were \ncalculated and compared to the conservative mixing line.Generally, salinization of a freshwater aquifer by seawater intrusion proceeds J. Bauer et al.', 'Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n6in the following steps (Appelo and Postma, 2004; Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999; Vengosh, 2013 ): In the early \nstages of salinization, fresh Ca2+-dominated groundwater is enriched in Na+and Mg2+.

What happens to the levels of different ions like Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in groundwater during the processes of salinization and freshening in coastal aquifers?	During the process of salinization, fresh groundwater that is initially dominated by Ca2+ becomes enriched in Na+ and Mg2+. As salinization intensifies, the monovalent ion Na+ increases proportionally with the increase in sorption, and it eventually replaces the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ from sedimentary rocks, forming Ca-Cl and Na-Mg-Cl waters. The overall salinity and the proportion of divalent cations also increase.On the other hand, during the process of freshening, which is the inflow of freshwater into saline coastal aquifers, the cation-exchange reaction is reversed. Freshwater of Ca-HCO3 type intrudes the saline aquifer and the exchangeable Na+ on mineral surfaces, especially clay minerals, is replaced by Ca2+ and Mg2+. This happens due to a higher sorption selectivity, and the water type changes to the characteristic Na-HCO3. The Na+/Cl- ratio increases above the level of seawater, while Ca2+ and Mg2+ become depleted.

Based on the information provided, how does the increase in salinity in the groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta affect their usability for direct drinking purposes?	The increase in salinity in the groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta can substantially degrade the quality of the groundwater. This degradation can limit its use for direct drinking purposes and potentially affect human health.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What is the role of organic matter in increasing the concentration of HCO3- in coastal aquifers, and how does this relate to salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?	Organic matter plays a crucial role in increasing the concentration of HCO3- in coastal aquifers. This is because dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter can be oxidized to dissolved inorganic carbon, which is a source of HCO3-. In fact, the concentration of HCO3- resulting from organic matter oxidation can exceed the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas several times over. Organic matter reduction also influences the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in PCO2 and changes in pH, leading to dissolution. In the context of the Mekong Delta, high amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers due to their marine and estuarial origin. This could account for high HCO3- concentrations. Sulfate reduction, which directly produces HCO3-, leads to sulfate depletion, a characteristic of freshening aquifers rich in organic matter. This could also apply to the Mekong Delta, indicating a potential link between organic matter and salinity intrusion.	['Another possible source of HCO 3- in coastal aquifers is dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter, which is oxidized to \ndissolved inorganic carbon.It was shown in other studies that the concentration of HCO 3- originating from organic matter oxidation \ncan surpass the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times (Chapelle and McMahon, 1991; Orem and \nGaudette, 1984 ).In addition, organic matter reduction also shifts the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in PCO2 as well as \nchanges in pH, and causes dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999 ).Due to their marine and estuarial origin, \nhigh amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers in CMP (Doan et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2010; \nPechstein et al., 2018 ) and could therefore account for high HCO 3- concentrations.Furthermore, sulfate reduction directly produces \nHCO 3- and leads to sulfate depletion, which is typical for freshening aquifers rich in organic matter and might therefore also apply to \nFig.8.Na+/Cl- plot of groundwater samples including water type markers associated with salinization of freshwater aquifers.J.

Based on the report, what is the main process leading to the abundant Na-HCO3 and Na-HCO3-(Cl) type groundwater in coastal areas, and how does it relate to salinity intrusion?	The main process leading to the abundant Na-HCO3 and Na-HCO3-(Cl) type groundwater in coastal areas is freshwater intrusion. This process is predominant and has resulted in these types of groundwater being common in these areas. The relationship with salinity intrusion is complex. An increase in EC values in coastal areas does not necessarily indicate recent seawater intrusion, but can also be due to the generation of additional HCO3-. The Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the study area is well above the seawater ratio of 0.86, indicating the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and freshening. The water type changes with increasing Cl- concentration, demonstrating the stages and geochemical processes associated with salinization. However, focusing on total salinity via EC analysis alone is not a suitable method for identifying signs of salinization. Instead, detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of Na+/Cl- molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes is a more appropriate tool.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n12CMP where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low (Kim et al., 2017; Chapelle and McMahon, 1991 ).Overall, this is an \nimportant finding, demonstrating that the increase of EC values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater \nintrusion, but can also be attributed to the generation of additional HCO 3-.4.2.Salinization and freshening processes \nCoastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion, \nrespectively (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Han et al., 2020 ).Fig.8 reveals that the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the \nstudy area is well above the seawater ratio of 0.86.Only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater.It is remarkable that the water \ntype of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing Cl- concentration from Mix-Cl-(HCO 3) and \nCa-Cl-(HCO 3) over Na-Mg-Cl and finally to Na-Cl, while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) \ntype.This observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and \nfreshening.The customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with \nsalinization.It can be observed that Na-Mg-Cl seem to occur at higher Cl- concentrations compared to Ca-Cl-(HCO 3) (see Fig.8), \nprobably because seawater contains more Mg2+over Ca2+with a Mg2+/Ca2+ratio of 4.5–5.2 (Vengosh, 2013 ).The Mg2+/Cl- ratio is \nshown in Fig.9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest Na+/Cl- ratios and salinization water types, again demonstrating the \ncation-exchange processes.The same pattern can be observed for Ca2+/Cl- (Fig.10) but with a wider spread and deviation from the \nmixing line, as Ca2+concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution, which in turn \ndepend on HCO 3- concentrations.In conclusion, freshwater intrusion is, or was, the predominant process leading to the abundant Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) type \ngroundwater in CMP.The rarely occurring groundwater of Na-Cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, where Cl- is still the dominant anion.Further freshening produces waters of Na-HCO 3 type and Cl- below 25mg/L, as found \nin the northeast of the study area.Due to the general hydrogeological conditions, it can also be assumed that the freshening process has \nprogressed furthest in this region.This assumption is supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- \nbetween 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east (Fig.7).It can be expected that both processes, cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decompo -\nsition, contribute to observed Na-HCO 3 groundwater in CMP.Detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of Na+/ \nCl- molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization, \neven in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.Focusing on total salinity via EC analysis alone, however, is not a suitable method.For \nexample, three samples in the central north (Fig.5c) have EC values below 1000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).However, based on their Na+/Cl- \nratio, which is below the seawater line (Fig.7), and their water type (Fig.3), particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of \nsalinization.4.3.Groundwater evolution and development \nMarine transgression and regression phases in the Quaternary (Fig.', 'A1 in appendix A) caused numerous cycles of alternating \nsaltwater and freshwater intrusions in the MD and coastal regions worldwide (Delsman et al., 2014; Pham et al., 2019; Spratt and \nLisiecki, 2016; van Engelen et al., 2021 ).In this period, phases of sedimentation during marine transgression were alternating with \nphases of extensive erosion during marine regression.Derived and edited after Pham et al.(2019) , Fig.11a-c illustrate three char-\nacteristic stages of past hydrogeological situations in the lower MD.The formation of Na-HCO 3 type groundwater dominant in CMP at \nmoderate EC levels with high Na+/Cl- ratios supports the assumption of Pham et al.(2019) that extensive freshwater intrusion \noccurred in the aquifer system of the MD.Previously, this assumption was only covered by the distribution of TDS.It furthermore \nFig.9.Mg2+/Cl- plot of groundwater samples including water type markers associated with salinization of freshwater aquifers.J. Bauer et al.']
What is the significance of the Na-HCO3 type groundwater dominant in CMP at moderate EC levels with high Na+/Cl- ratios in the Mekong Delta?	The dominance of Na-HCO3 type groundwater in CMP at moderate EC levels with high Na+/Cl- ratios signifies that freshwater intrusion is, or was, the predominant process in this region. This type of groundwater is abundant in CMP and is a result of freshening processes, where chloride is no longer the dominant anion. The presence of such groundwater in the northeast of the study area, where Cl- is below 25mg/L, suggests that the freshening process has progressed furthest in this region. This is further supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- between 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east. Therefore, the Na-HCO3 type groundwater is a key indicator of the salinization and freshening processes in the Mekong Delta.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n114.Discussion \n4.1.Groundwater composition \nThe shift of the fresh-saline water boundary further inland is a major concern for water management in CMP, as an increase of \nsalinity would significantly degrade groundwater resources and limit their use.40 out of 190 samples exceed the Vietnamese limit for \ntotal dissolved solids (TDS) of 1500 mg/L (MONRE, 2015 ), which is equivalent to an EC value of 1850 µS/cm (see chapter 3.1).47 \nsamples exceed the threshold for Cl- of 250mg/L.Thus, some groundwater is already unsuitable for direct drinking purpose.Data \ncollected in this study, however, also show that locations with elevated EC are randomly distributed across CMP and are most often \nrepresented by more than one sample at each location from both Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers.This leads to the conclusion that \nlocations of elevated EC are not a single well phenomenon but a local spatial pattern.This is also true for other ions and ion ratios, as \nshown in Figs.5 and 7.This indicates that aquifers are to some extend connected, at least partly, either through natural discontinuities \nin the stratigraphy, as also recently proposed by other authors (Doan et al., 2018; Pechstein et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2019 ), or hy-\ndrological short circuits caused by well leakage or well failure (Doan et al., 2018 ), which are rarely considered.In a regional \nperspective, no significant correlation between geochemical patterns and depth or aquifer was found, as shown by the correlation \nanalysis (Table A1 in appendix A) and by the geological cross section (Fig.6).In addition, locations with higher EC are not correlated to \nthe distance to the coast.As a simple and straightforward measure of salinity, EC is a useful parameter to characterize and classify groundwater resources in \ncoastal regions potentially affected by seawater intrusion, especially when detailed analysis is not available.Seawater of Na-Cl type is \nlargely uniform with a TDS of around 35g/L, while freshwater is often defined with a TDS concentration below 1g/L (Vengosh, 2013 ), \nmeaning that even slight seawater intrusion is detectable.However, groundwater composition is often more complex and other pa-\nrameters than Na+and Cl- are affecting EC as well (Jones et al., 1999 ).This also applies to data presented in this study.As shown in \nFig.5a-c, elevated levels of EC in the southern part of the study region cannot solely be attributed to Cl- associated with seawater but \nrather to the presence of high HCO 3- concentrations.In fact, around Nam Can groundwater with EC >2000 µS/cm is of Na-HCO 3 and \nNa-HCO 3-(Cl) type (Fig.3) and HCO 3- concentrations are lowest inland in the northeastern area, where recent freshwater inflow is \nestimated to occur, even though it might be limited (Fig.5a).This indicates that the source of HCO 3- is not freshwater intrusion.Almost \nall samples are oversaturated to calcite (n=158), especially in the south and central south between CMC and Nam Can (Fig.A5 in \nappendix A), which should lead to calcite precipitation.Only a few samples in the northern part of the study area are slightly un-\ndersaturated to calcite (n=5) or in equilibrium (n=27).One reason for the oversaturation of calcite might be the addition of Ca2+\ndue to cation exchange processes or the dissolution of gypsum (Plummer et al., 1990 ), which has a SI between \x001.56 and \x006.21.This \ncontradicts typical hydrochemical facies evolution in coastal areas, where SIcalcite tends to decrease towards the sea (Custodio and \nBruggerman, 1987 ).Ca2+and HCO 3- have a negative correlation and while HCO 3- concentrations increase, Ca2+concentrations are \nrelatively low, probably because Ca2+is involved in complex ion exchange processes (Jones et al., 1999 ).It is therefore concluded that \nobserved high concentrations of HCO 3- in the south of the study area cannot be explained by simple mixing and calcite dissolution.', 'Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n12CMP where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low (Kim et al., 2017; Chapelle and McMahon, 1991 ).Overall, this is an \nimportant finding, demonstrating that the increase of EC values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater \nintrusion, but can also be attributed to the generation of additional HCO 3-.4.2.Salinization and freshening processes \nCoastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion, \nrespectively (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Han et al., 2020 ).Fig.8 reveals that the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the \nstudy area is well above the seawater ratio of 0.86.Only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater.It is remarkable that the water \ntype of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing Cl- concentration from Mix-Cl-(HCO 3) and \nCa-Cl-(HCO 3) over Na-Mg-Cl and finally to Na-Cl, while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) \ntype.This observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and \nfreshening.The customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with \nsalinization.It can be observed that Na-Mg-Cl seem to occur at higher Cl- concentrations compared to Ca-Cl-(HCO 3) (see Fig.8), \nprobably because seawater contains more Mg2+over Ca2+with a Mg2+/Ca2+ratio of 4.5–5.2 (Vengosh, 2013 ).The Mg2+/Cl- ratio is \nshown in Fig.9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest Na+/Cl- ratios and salinization water types, again demonstrating the \ncation-exchange processes.The same pattern can be observed for Ca2+/Cl- (Fig.10) but with a wider spread and deviation from the \nmixing line, as Ca2+concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution, which in turn \ndepend on HCO 3- concentrations.In conclusion, freshwater intrusion is, or was, the predominant process leading to the abundant Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) type \ngroundwater in CMP.The rarely occurring groundwater of Na-Cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, where Cl- is still the dominant anion.Further freshening produces waters of Na-HCO 3 type and Cl- below 25mg/L, as found \nin the northeast of the study area.Due to the general hydrogeological conditions, it can also be assumed that the freshening process has \nprogressed furthest in this region.This assumption is supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- \nbetween 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east (Fig.7).It can be expected that both processes, cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decompo -\nsition, contribute to observed Na-HCO 3 groundwater in CMP.Detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of Na+/ \nCl- molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization, \neven in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.Focusing on total salinity via EC analysis alone, however, is not a suitable method.For \nexample, three samples in the central north (Fig.5c) have EC values below 1000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).However, based on their Na+/Cl- \nratio, which is below the seawater line (Fig.7), and their water type (Fig.3), particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of \nsalinization.4.3.Groundwater evolution and development \nMarine transgression and regression phases in the Quaternary (Fig.']
"""What caused the prevention of extensive seawater intrusion, which could have led to salinization, in the Mekong Delta during the Holocene transgression phase?"""	The prevention of extensive seawater intrusion, which could have led to salinization, in the Mekong Delta during the Holocene transgression phase was caused by the formation of large-scale impermeable Holocene aquitards, particularly QP3, between 8 and 6 ka BP.

\nDelsman et al., 2014 ; Han et al., 2020 ; Post and Kooi, 2003 ; van Engelen et al., 2021 ).However, such salinization signatures are \npresent at a few locations.Due to the high groundwater exploitation rates as well as the high hydraulic connectivity within and \napparently across the aquifers it is rather unlikely that these samples reflect remnants of older saline groundwater unaffected by the \nlatest freshening event.Furthermore, these samples plot below the conservative mixing line at low to moderate EC levels, which \nindicates that they developed from freshwater and are in an early stage of salinization (Fig.8) rather than in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, as it is the case for same samples of Na-Cl type above the mixing line.Therefore, it is more likely that former freshwater \nmixed with saline water more recently.However, the origin of this recent salinization is not further examined in this study, but it \nshould be noted that the MD was completely inundated at around 5.5 ka BP and CMP until estimated 2 ka BP (Fig.11c) (Nguyen et al., \n2000; Pham et al., 2019 ).The current stratification with high-density Holocene saline aquifers on top of low-density deep freshwater \naquifers reflects an unstable aquifer situation, which might lead to a downward migration of the younger saline groundwater along \nnatural and anthropogenic pathways (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Post and Kooi, 2003 ).It must be noted that the subsurface in \nthe study region is virtually perforated with abandoned as well as active wells of different construction quality and reliability.The Piper diagram (Fig.4) shows that in average the proportion of Na+is notably higher in Pliocene than in Pleistocene samples, \nwhich is illustrated in Fig.11c.This finding might indicate the heterogeneous downwards migration of saline water from top to \nbottom, which leads to the release of divalent cations in Pleistocene aquifers, which therefore show a wide range of Na+(%).In \naddition, differences in geomorphology and discontinuities in the stratigraphy probably resulted in non-uniform downward migration \nFig.10.Ca2+/Cl- plot of groundwater samples including water type markers associated with salinization of freshwater aquifers.Fig.11.Scheme of the past hydrogeological situations in CMP edited after Pham et al.(2019) .Black horizontal dotted arrows indicate lateral \naquifer recharge from outside the study area (exemplary displayed for aquifer n22).The blue vertical arrows indicate depth of vertical direct \nfreshwater recharge.Sea levels were correlated with the paleo surface using sediment dating techniques (summarized in Pham et al., 2019 ).(For \ninterpretation of the references to colour in this figure, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)J.

Based on the report, what is the potential impact of current practices on the salinity of deep aquifers and the availability of freshwater in the Mekong Delta over the long term?	"The current practices in the Mekong Delta, particularly the overexploitation of groundwater, can lead to several negative environmental impacts. One of the most prominent impacts is the decrease of hydraulic heads, which increases the potential for seawater intrusion. This intrusion could significantly degrade the quality of groundwater, limit its use, and affect human health. Additionally, the overexploitation of groundwater can induce severe local land subsidence, resulting in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, along with other factors such as natural compaction of sediment layers, decline of fluvial sediment supply, salinization of surface water, sea-level rise due to global climate change, and weather extremes, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. The overall problems can be summarized as a progressive ""loss of land and freshwater,"" which could eventually lead to the inundation of large parts of the delta."	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

"""What are the main causes of soil salinization and how does it affect agricultural productivity, particularly rice production, in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?"""	The main causes of soil salinization in the Mekong Delta, specifically in Hau Giang province, are seawater intrusion and salinized groundwater. This accumulation of soluble salts in the soil negatively impacts agricultural production. It can render productive land areas unsuitable for farming or significantly reduce crop yield. To mitigate the adverse effects of salinity, especially in areas with a moderate level of total soluble salts, certain strategies can be employed. These include suitable irrigation methods, the use of salt-tolerant crop varieties, and the application of lime (CaCO3).

What are the impacts of saltwater intrusion on agricultural production and sustainability in coastal regions like the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, as mentioned in the report on climate change?	Saltwater intrusion into coastal regions like the Mekong Delta in Vietnam can have several detrimental effects on agricultural production and sustainability. This process, which is exacerbated by climate change and factors like sea-level rise and drought, can lead to progressive land degradation, particularly in river deltas. The intrusion of saltwater into freshwater sources near the sea can impair plant uptake of water and essential nutrients, negatively affect crop growth and development, increase weed competition, decrease soil microbial activity, and overall reduce crop productivity. These impacts threaten the preservation and sustainability of coastal agriculture, as well as its unique role in historical heritage.

"""What are the impacts of saltwater intrusion and climate change on coastal agriculture, as discussed in the 2023 study by Tarolli et al.?"""	Saltwater intrusion and climate change pose significant threats to coastal agriculture. These threats are particularly severe in areas where agriculture depends on optimal water resource management. Changing climatic conditions can endanger the preservation and sustainability of coastal agriculture and its unique historical heritage. Freshwater sources near the sea are at risk of saltwater intrusion, a process resulting from both natural and anthropogenic drivers. Climate change, particularly sea-level rise and drought, can cause progressive land degradation, especially in river deltas. This degradation negatively impacts the sustainable development of agriculture, society, and economy. Droughts can lead to particularly severe saltwater intrusion events as lack of rainfall results in scarce river discharge and favors marine water inland flow intrusion. The impacts on agricultural production include impaired plant uptake of water and essential nutrients, negative effects on crop growth and development, increased weed competition, lower soil microbial activity, and overall crop productivity reduction. The study presents the case of two critical regions, the Po River Delta and the Mekong Delta, which are considered global hotspots for the saltwater intrusion phenomenon.

"""What are the main factors that have led to the increased frequency of saltwater intrusion in the Po River delta and how has it affected the area's natural resources and agricultural productivity?"""	The increased frequency of saltwater intrusion in the Po River delta has been caused by several factors. These include the pumping of groundwater, the reduced flow of the river due to damming and irrigation, rising sea levels, and subsidence, which was largely caused by massive extractions of methane from the subsoil in the 1950s and 60s. Climate change has also played a significant role, exacerbating these factors and leading to increasingly frequent arid conditions. This saltwater intrusion has had severe impacts on the area's natural resources and agricultural productivity. It has led to soil salinization, habitat loss, and reduced agricultural productivity. During periods of drought, the intrusion of saltwater along the tributaries of the delta can reach many kilometers from the sea, causing water salinity to exceed the critical threshold for irrigation. This makes it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to adhere to irrigation schedules, worsening the water shortage. The consequences can be dramatic for agricultural production, leading to soil fertility deterioration, vegetation loss, and micro desertification of large field portions.

Based on the report, how could climate change potentially affect the temperature and climate of the Mekong Delta, particularly for rice crops?	Climate change could potentially lead to a rise in sea levels, which in turn exacerbates the intrusion of saltwater into the Mekong Delta region. This saltwater intrusion deteriorates soil quality, making it difficult to cultivate rice paddies. The salinity of the water surface increases as seawater intrudes into the local rivers. This issue has drawn significant attention and has led to the development of methods to monitor soil salinity. The severity of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta is expected to increase in the dry season of 2023, posing a further threat to the rice supply.

Based on the studies mentioned in the context, what are the main causes and impacts of the saline water intrusion disaster in the Mekong Delta in 2020?	The main causes of the saline water intrusion disaster in the Mekong Delta in 2020 are attributed to four factors: upstream hydropower dams, land subsidence, the relative sea-level rise, and riverbed sand mining. The impacts of this disaster have been severe. The intrusion of saltwater has led to the deterioration of soil quality, making it difficult to cultivate rice paddies. The salinity of the water surface rises as seawater intrudes into the Hau and Tien rivers, extending to 45–65 km and 55–60 km from the coastline, respectively. This has drawn significant attention from both domestic and international private and public sectors and scientists. The severity of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta is expected to increase in the dry season of 2023, further threatening the rice supply in the foreseeable future.

What is the willingness of farm households in the Mekong River Delta to contribute to a salinity intrusion risk reduction program, and how does it vary in areas where salinity intrusion is already reducing productivity, expected to reduce productivity by 2030, and not expected within the next 15 years?	Over half of the farm households in the Mekong River Delta are willing to contribute to a fund aimed at reducing salinity intrusion risk. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity. Those households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs compared to those in areas with lower or no current risk. However, even households that are currently unaffected by salinity intrusion are willing to contribute to a salinity management program. The total amount that these households are prepared to pay is substantial and may be enough to cover the total costs of such a program.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
"""What are the two processes causing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how could this issue potentially impact the agricultural area by 2030?"""	The two processes causing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta are rising sea levels due to adverse climate change and a significant decline in river flows resulting from upstream dam construction and increased extractions of water. This issue could potentially impact up to 45% of the Mekong River Delta's agricultural area by 2030, with coastal provinces such as Tien Giang, Tra Vinh, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, and Ben Tre experiencing the highest levels of impact.

What are some of the short-term and long-term solutions being considered to manage the increasing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?	One of the short-term solutions being considered to manage the increasing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta is for farmers to adapt to the conditions. This could involve shifting from rice production to fish or shrimp farming, which are more tolerant to salinity. A long-term solution that has been proposed is the construction of concrete sea-dikes. Around 1469 km of these dikes could be built to help control the salinity intrusion.

"""Based on the report, are local households in the Mekong River Delta expected to contribute to the construction and maintenance of sea-dike walls to mitigate salinity intrusion risk?"""	Yes, the report suggests that local households may be expected to contribute to the cost of running a salinity intrusion control program, which could include the construction and maintenance of sea-dike walls.

What factors have been identified in previous studies as influencing a farm household's willingness to pay for climate change risk reduction programs, such as those aimed at managing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta?	The factors identified that influence a farm household's willingness to pay for climate change risk reduction programs include the expected impacts of salinity intrusion and whether or not the household is currently affected by salinity intrusion. Households located in areas currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those located in lower or no-current risk areas. However, even those households that are currently unaffected by salinity intrusion are willing to pay for a salinity management program. The total amount that farm households are prepared to pay is significant and may be sufficient to cover the total costs of such a program.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']

The context does not provide information on the five different bid values chosen for the monthly payment vehicle in the study or how they were determined.	['As stated above,  in  our  CVM  survey  farm  households  were  asked\nto  respond  to  the  willingness  to  pay  bid  value  question  in  one  of\nthree  ways:  ‘Yes,’  ‘No’  or  ‘Do  not  know’.In  the  analysis  model  /H9251  and\nˇ  are  coefﬁcients,  and  X  is  a  vector  of  the  socio-economic  explana-\ntory  variables  related  to  an  individual’s  selection  including:  farm\nhousehold  income,  head  of  household’s  age,  head  of  household’s\ngender,  farm  household  size,  head  of  household’s  education  and\ntotal  farming  experience  (Table  1).The  non-parametric  technique  is\nemployed  to  estimate  the  mean  values  for  WTP.This  technique  was\nsuggested  by  previous  researchers  in  the  same  survey  area  (Ðan\nand  Duyên,  2010 ;

 Botzen  and  van  den  Bergh,  2012 ;  Zhai,  2006 ).For  exam-\nple,  willingness  to  pay  was  positively  associated  with  the  size  of\nthe  risk  reduction  (Alberini  and  Chiabai,  2007 ;  Botzen  and  van\nden  Bergh,  2012 ;  Zhai,  2006 ),  respondent  age  and  health  (Alberini\nand  Chiabai,  2007 ),  income  (Zhai,  2006 )  and  proximity  to  the  risk\n(Concu,  2007 ).However,  WTP  can  decrease  with  acceptability  of\n(ﬂood)  risk  and  environmental  information  provision  (Zhai,  2006 ).Moreover,  risk awareness and  geographical  characteristics  are  also\nnoted  as  important  factors  inﬂuencing  respondents’  willingness  to\npay (Botzen  and  Van  Den  Bergh,  2008 ).In  those  studies,  referen-\ndum  and  payment  cards  were  employed  broadly  as  the  instrument\nof CVM elicitation,  and  so  we  follow  that  approach  in  this  paper.2.Methods\nConsistent  with  many  of  the  studies  of  climate  change  risk\nreduction  cited  above,  we  employ  the  CVM  approach  to  estimate\nfarm  household  willingness  to  pay  for  MRD  salinity  intrusion  man-\nagement  programs.CVM  was  ﬁrst  proposed  by  Ciriacy-Wantrup\n(1947) ,  and  since  the  1970s  the  methodology  has  been  routinely\napplied  to  measure  the  beneﬁts  of  a  variety  of  goods  such  as  recre-\nation,  hunting,  water  quality  and  decreased  mortality  risk  from\naccidents  (Khai  and  Yabe,  2014 ).In  essence,  CVM  requires  each\nparticipant  in  a  study  to  respond  by  employing  four  types  of  ques-\ntion  including  open-ended,  dichotomous  choice,  iterative  bidding\nor  payment  card.The  most  common  question  format  is  an  open-\nended  and  dichotomous  choice.Although  debate  over  the  best\nform  of  CVM  questionnaire  continues,  dichotomous  choice  rather\nthan  open-ended  elicitation  approaches  are  recommended  due\nto  minimization  of  opportunities  for  strategic  behaviour,  and  an\nargument  that  such  questions  are  cognitively  easier  on  respon-\ndents  (Mitchell  and  Carson,  1989 ).The  valuation  question  in  this\nstudy  thus  required  each  participant  to  respond  to  a  dichotomous\nchoice  based  on  WTP  guidelines  by  Bateman  et  al.(2002)  and  the\nCompetition Commission  (2010) .']
What are the proposed program options for reducing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how would they be funded according to the survey conducted?	The proposed program options for reducing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta include converting current earth sea-dike-walls to concrete structures, upgrading existing or building new river-mouth sluicegate systems, and planting new or reforesting degraded existing mangrove systems next to sea-dike-walls. According to the survey conducted, these programs would be funded by monthly contributions from households. The collected funds would be administered by a committee composed of local government, local and international consultants, and representatives from non-government organizations. This committee would then decide how to invest in concrete sea-dike-walls, sluice-gate construction, and mangrove forests in their local area.

What methods were used in the study to reduce the likelihood of over-estimation in farmers' willingness to pay for measures against salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?	The study used a field survey method to collect primary data. The questionnaire was pre-tested with 30 randomly-selected farm household heads across three different areas of the Mekong River Delta (MRD) to ensure farmer comprehension and refine the range of willingness to pay bid measures proposed. The survey also tested the feasibility of getting farmers to make a monthly contribution to a fund managed by their local authority. Based on the pre-test results, five different bid values were chosen for the monthly payment vehicle. The survey was then conducted among three farmer groups in different areas, using simple random sampling techniques. The causes of salinity intrusion in the MRD were carefully explained to respondents to collect reliable willingness to pay information.	['The  robustness  of  the  decision  to\nadopt  a  dichotomous  choice  format  was  enhanced  in  this  instance\nby  a  large  sample  of  farm  households.2.1.Survey  method\nThe  primary  data  for  the  study  was  obtained  through  a  ﬁeld\nsurvey  conducted  among  farm  households  in  the  MRD.The\nquestionnaire  was  pre-tested  with  30  randomly-selected  farm\nhousehold  heads  spread  across  three  MRD  study  areas  ranging  from\nheavily  salinity-affected  areas,  down  to  non-salinity-affected  areas.The  purpose  of  the  pre-test  was  to  check  likely  farmer  comprehen-\nsion  of  the  questionnaire,  reﬁne  the  range  of  willingness  to  pay\nbid  measures  proposed,  and  test  the  viability  of  the  proposed  pay-\nment  vehicle;

Based on the study, what were the main reasons some farm households in the Mekong River Delta were unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program?	The main reasons some farm households in the Mekong River Delta were unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program include: they could not afford the amount required, they did not believe the amount they would pay would actually be used for the program, they felt it was the government's responsibility to handle the issue, and they believed they could deal with the situation using their own adaptation options.

Based on the study, are experienced farmers in the Mekong River Delta less likely to be willing to pay for salinity intrusion reduction programs, and if so, why might this be the case?	The study does not provide information on whether experienced farmers in the Mekong River Delta are less likely to be willing to pay for salinity intrusion reduction programs. However, it does indicate that farm households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in lower or no-current risk areas. The study also suggests that some farmers might adapt to salinity intrusion by shifting from rice production to fish or shrimp farming.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
What is the average monthly contribution that farm households in the Mekong Delta are willing to make towards salinity reduction programs, according to the study?	Farm households in the Mekong Delta, according to the study, are willing to contribute approximately US$2.58 per month if they are already experiencing high salinity intrusion. However, farms in the control group are only willing to contribute around half of that amount, which is about US$1.32 per month.

Based on the study, what is the willingness of farm households in the Mekong River Delta to contribute financially towards projects aimed at mitigating the impacts of salinity intrusion?	The study reveals that over half of the farm households in the Mekong River Delta are willing to contribute financially to a fund aimed at reducing the risk of salinity intrusion. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity. Those households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in lower or no-current risk areas.

One possible solution to control salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta is to construct around 1469 km of concrete sea-dikes.

What information does the sea-dike map provide about the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	The sea-dike map provides information about the infrastructure in place to manage salinity intrusion and flooding in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam. Over the last 300 years, more than 11,000 kilometers of canals and approximately 2000 kilometers of dike walls have been constructed to mitigate these issues. The Vietnamese government has plans to upgrade these dike walls and increase maintenance in the central and southern Mekong River Delta, including the construction of additional earthen sea-dikes and concrete sluice gates along the coastline. However, due to budget constraints and a shortage of suitable soils, there is consideration being given to the construction of concrete sea-dike walls. The total length of required sea-dike walls in the Mekong River Delta would be 1469 kilometers.

What are the challenges posed by climate change, such as sea level rise, stronger monsoons, and more frequent droughts, to the agriculture in the Mekong Delta, particularly in relation to saline soils and freshwater resources?	Climate change poses significant challenges to agriculture in the Mekong Delta, particularly in relation to saline soils and freshwater resources. Rising sea levels and stronger monsoons can lead to increased salinity in the soil and water, making them less suitable for traditional crops and drinking purposes. Droughts can exacerbate this issue by reducing the availability of freshwater resources and increasing the concentration of salts in the soil and water. The changing climate has also altered the predictable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes, making it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops. The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS2 buildup leading to reduced agriculture productivity, and degrades surface water quality. These changes also make aquatic ecosystems vulnerable and present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges for farmers. The increase in population and the rise in food and nutrition insecurity are further challenging the region to enhance their adaptation and agricultural production strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and livelihoods for Vietnamese farmers.

Luu et al.2022).At first natural waterways were straight-\nened and deepened, and then connected by canals.The French Colonial Government set about clearing forests and draining wetlands to turn the underutilized and agriculturally unproductive soils into rice production.These sparsely populated, densely vegetated acid sulfate lands were used by resistance fighters as hideouts dur -\ning the US Vietnam War (1961 to 1973).After the war, the Vietnam state established large-scale state farms (1,000 to 10,000 ha [2,471 to 24,710 ac]) to increase the delta population and alleviate serious food shortages (van Mensvoort 1996).Newly resettled farmers were inexperienced in managing waterlogged acid sulfate soils to make them productive, and the state farms were inadequately funded with a shortage of knowledge and equipment resources as well as insufficient farm workers for large-scale parcels.Excess water on the landscape in monsoon season alternating with dry season freshwater scarcity made delta living conditions harsh, and most of these collective farms failed to grow enough food for farmers to make a living (van Mensvoort 1996).By the mid-1980s irrigation projects \nexpanded throughout the delta to create a freshwater network across the entire pen-insula with sluice gates that protected the waterway grid from saline intrusion and reengineered the waterscape to drain and control water for rice agriculture (Taylor 2014).Rice establishes and grows well in waterlogged environments but is sensitive to salinity with an electric conductivity (EC\nSPE) threshold of 3 dS m–1 (Korres et \nal.2022).The saline delta rivers, wetlands, and marshes were converted into peren-nial freshwater zones.This reduced the seasonal variation in water flow patterns, converted the flood plain into regulated canals, dykes, and polders that irrigated agriculture, and prevented annual flood waters from submerging fields (and sedi -\nments from replenishing soil fertility) (Luu et.2022).T oday’s Vietnam Mekong Delta agri -\ncultural landscape is built on managing and controlling the quantity and distri-bution of water year round (flooding, irrigation, fresh and saline waters) in allu -\nvial and acid sulfate soils (figure 2).', '91A\nJULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4 JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONLIVING WITH SALINITY: AGRICULTURAL \nADAPTATIONS TO SALINE ACID \nSULFATE SOILS\nOne meter (3.3 ft) of sea-level rise would \ninundate 79% of Ca Mau and 76% of Kien Giang provinces in the Vietnam Mekong Delta.The World Bank (2022) predicts that without adaptation, 45% of the delta will be affected by salinity.Below are eight rec -\nommendations to guide Vietnam Mekong Delta policymakers, scientists, local leaders, and farmers in effectively adapting and liv -\ning with salinity while continuing to make acid sulfate soils productive and delta eco -\nsystems sustainable and healthy: \n1. widen the adoption of di versified \ncropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization;\n2. incr ease research, field evaluations, and \napplications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improve plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater;\n3. incr ease freshwater flows and aquifer \nrecharge to offset saltwater intrusion;\n4. pr oactively prepare and protect lands \nand settlements to increase resilience against tropical cyclones;

Ngan et al.2018; Luu et al.2022).While Vietnamese Mekong Delta farmers have learned over the decades to manage flood-drought cycles in acid sulfate soils, the increasing instability in global cli-mate and local weather conditions present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges.The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS\n2 buildup leading to reduced \nagriculture productivity, degrades surface water quality, and makes aquatic ecosys -\ntems vulnerable (Tully et al.2019; Mosley et al.2017).A changing climate has altered the \npredicable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes and made it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops.Climate change, sea level rise, human land use management, increased population, and the rise in food and nutrition insecurity is again challenging the region to ratchet up their adaptation and agricultural pro -\nduction strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and that Vietnamese farmers are able to make a living.Local and indigenous farmer knowl-\nedge and university scientific research have combined to create innovative land man-agement approaches, engineer extensive water management projects, and develop salt-tolerant crop varieties to make acid sulfate soils agriculturally productive.Continuous research and experimentation will be needed to respond and prepare for present and future uncertainties.Adaptive integration of biogeophysical, \npedogenic, and social knowledge is critical in deepening understanding of landscape and local surface level drainage impacts and soil-water relationships under increas -\ningly variable conditions.Observing and learning more about the connections and synergies among rates of percolation, soil management effects on macropores and mesopores, the role of bypass flows in raised bed soil leaching processes, densities and types of beneficial bacteria in pro-ductive soils, and plant breeding for salt tolerance will be essential to living with uncertainty and strengthening delta sus -\ntainability and resilience.']

"""How has the transformation of the Mekong Delta into an agricultural landscape affected the salinity of the soil and water, and what measures are being taken to adapt to these changes?"""	The transformation of the Mekong Delta into an agricultural landscape involved large irrigation programs that constructed canals to channel fresh water from the Mekong and Bassac rivers, reducing water and soil salinity. This process replaced the wetland ecosystem with agricultural systems. However, the saline delta rivers, wetlands, and marshes were converted into perennial freshwater zones, which altered the seasonal variation in water flow patterns. This change also converted the flood plain into regulated canals, dykes, and polders that irrigated agriculture, preventing annual flood waters from submerging fields and replenishing soil fertility.In response to these changes and the increasing salinity of the soil and water, several measures are being taken. These include widening the adoption of diversified cropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization. There is also an increase in research, field evaluations, and applications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improving plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater. Other measures include increasing freshwater flows and aquifer recharge to offset saltwater intrusion, proactively preparing and protecting lands and settlements to increase resilience against tropical cyclones, and managing pesticide and fertilizer use to meet crop nutrient needs while reducing contamination.

What measures are being taken to control salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how does saltwater intrusion during drought periods affect the soil and agriculture in the region?	Measures being taken to control salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta include water control projects, which consist of high dyke and flood control, and salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture. Canals that link to the Bassac and Mekong main stem rivers and their distributaries are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements. During the rainy season, these canals are used to drain the land and release flood waters back into rivers and seas. Sluice gates are also used to allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide, and are closed during the dry season and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields.During drought periods, saltwater intrusion can exacerbate, altering soil geochemistry and changing soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. This intrusion can affect the coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease and allow saline water to move further inland. The landward movement of saltwater can make the acidic delta soils less productive for crops and the shallow groundwater salty and unsafe for cooking or drinking. This can also affect the growth of crops like rice, which establishes and grows well in waterlogged environments but is sensitive to salinity.	['Water control projects consist of high dyke and flood control, salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture, and salinity control in brackish water aquaculture (Ngan et al 2018).Canals that link to the Bassac and Mekong main stem rivers and their dis -\ntributaries are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements.During the rainy season, many of these same canals are used to drain the land and release flood waters back into rivers and the West and East China Seas (Ngan et al 2018; Hanhart et al.1997).Extensive agricultural drain-age ditches and canals lower the water table and speed up hydrologic exchanges between the coastal landscape and the ocean which can increase salt concentra -\ntion (Tully et al.2019).Sluice gates allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide and are closed during the dry sea -\nson and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields (figure 2).ACID SULFATE SOILS OF THE VIETNAM \nMEKONG DELTA \nAcid sulfate soils occupy more than 40% of the Vietnam Mekong Delta (figure 1).Soils are characterized by high Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations and low pH 2.7 to \n3.5, >0.5 mol Fe2+ and 0.05 mol Al3+ m–3.A large portion of these soils are under-water annually for several months during the monsoon season.Sea level rise, sea -\nsonal and increasingly variable cyclones, coastal storms, and high tides flood coastal regions and push seawater upriver mix-ing with fresh water.The onset of the dry season is accompanied by receding waters and shifting salinity concentrations in the waterways with sluice gates and dyke sys-tems built to irrigate and drain the interior landscape and control salinity intrusion.Drought periods can exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease and allow saline water to move further inland (Tully et al.2019).Saltwater intrusion, the land-ward movement of saltwater, alters soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', '86A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4security and rural livelihoods (World Bank \n2022;

What are some of the strategies mentioned in the report to alleviate the effects of acid sulfate soils and improve crop yields in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam?	The report suggests several strategies to mitigate the effects of acid sulfate soils and improve crop yields in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. These include:1. Widening the adoption of diversified cropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization.2. Increasing research, field evaluations, and applications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improving plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater.3. Increasing freshwater flows and aquifer recharge to offset saltwater intrusion.4. Preparing and protecting lands and settlements to increase resilience against tropical cyclones, drought-flooding extremes, and soil, coastal, and riverbank erosion.5. Managing pesticide and fertilizer use to meet crop nutrient needs while simultaneously reducing and eliminating pesticide and fertilizer contamination of soil, ditches, canals, and rivers.6. Restoring and maintaining wetlands and mangrove forests as multibenefit resources.7. Enabling delta farmers and fishers to make a living that supports their households.8. Restricting new development in eco-sensitive and fragile environmental regions, and strengthening and enforcing land use regulations. Furthermore, the report emphasizes the importance of continuous research and experimentation to respond and prepare for present and future uncertainties. Understanding the connections and synergies among rates of percolation, soil management effects on macropores and mesopores, the role of bypass flows in raised bed soil leaching processes, densities and types of beneficial bacteria in productive soils, and plant breeding for salt tolerance will be essential to living with uncertainty and strengthening delta sustainability and resilience.

What factors influence the height of the constructed raised beds in the Mekong Delta, and how does this impact the availability of soil volume for roots and the movement of water through the soil?	The height of the constructed raised beds in the Mekong Delta is influenced by several factors including the depth to the acid sulfate horizon, the depth to the water table during the growing season, the role of capillary rise, the specific crop being grown, and the time and cost of labor. The height of these beds has a direct impact on the soil volume available for roots and the movement of water through the soil. Higher raised beds create a thicker zone of leaching, increasing the distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, which in turn increases the available soil volume for roots. Additionally, freshly excavated soil that is deposited as ridges or shaped into raised beds creates a network of macropores between soil clods. These macropores enable water to flow through the topsoil and bypass the unsaturated soil matrix. As a result, water can move quickly through the macropores of newly constructed raised beds.	['The depth to the acid sulfate hori -\nzon, depth to water table during growing season, the role of capillary rise, the spe -\ncific crop grown, and the time and cost of labor influence the height of the con -\nstructed raised beds.Evapotranspiration will pull water upwards during the dry season, potentially leaving behind Na\n2SO4 \nand other salts.The higher the raised bed, the thicker the zone of leaching will be and distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, thus increasing the available soil volume for roots.Freshly excavated soil deposited as \nridges or shaped into raised beds create a network of macropores between soil clods that enable water to flow through the top -\nsoil and bypass the unsaturated soil matrix.Water moving through the macropores of newly constructed raised beds can quickly Figure 2\nThis sluice gate in Soc Trang Province, Vietnam, connects a main canal to the \nSouth China Sea and controls saltwater tidal inflow and flooding outflow.Open sluice gates allow fields to drain after heavy rains and flooding and are closed during high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to irrigate agricultural fields.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', 'Water control projects consist of high dyke and flood control, salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture, and salinity control in brackish water aquaculture (Ngan et al 2018).Canals that link to the Bassac and Mekong main stem rivers and their dis -\ntributaries are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements.During the rainy season, many of these same canals are used to drain the land and release flood waters back into rivers and the West and East China Seas (Ngan et al 2018; Hanhart et al.1997).Extensive agricultural drain-age ditches and canals lower the water table and speed up hydrologic exchanges between the coastal landscape and the ocean which can increase salt concentra -\ntion (Tully et al.2019).Sluice gates allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide and are closed during the dry sea -\nson and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields (figure 2).ACID SULFATE SOILS OF THE VIETNAM \nMEKONG DELTA \nAcid sulfate soils occupy more than 40% of the Vietnam Mekong Delta (figure 1).Soils are characterized by high Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations and low pH 2.7 to \n3.5, >0.5 mol Fe2+ and 0.05 mol Al3+ m–3.A large portion of these soils are under-water annually for several months during the monsoon season.Sea level rise, sea -\nsonal and increasingly variable cyclones, coastal storms, and high tides flood coastal regions and push seawater upriver mix-ing with fresh water.The onset of the dry season is accompanied by receding waters and shifting salinity concentrations in the waterways with sluice gates and dyke sys-tems built to irrigate and drain the interior landscape and control salinity intrusion.Drought periods can exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease and allow saline water to move further inland (Tully et al.2019).Saltwater intrusion, the land-ward movement of saltwater, alters soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation']
What is the process and purpose of flushing raised beds with fresh water in the context of dealing with salinity and acid sulfate soils in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Flushing raised beds with fresh water, which is water low in electrical conductivity and dissolved metals, is done two or three times before a crop is planted. This process is used to remove or leach soluble Al and other soluble substances from the surface of the soil clods into the drainage or irrigation ditch. The purpose of this process is to remove additional toxic substances that can affect crop roots and plant development. The substances that are flushed with fresh water include soil Al, Fe, and SO42– concentrations. This is done in annual raised bed systems that are submerged during normal flooding and then planted after the flooding recedes. The process of flushing can also help reduce Al leaching by slowing the movement of water through the soil profile. However, it should be noted that when fresh water removes the Al from the soil, it can concentrate in the outflow to the ditch and potentially increase contamination in irrigation water downstream.	['88A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL. 78, NO. 4remove/leach soluble Al and other soluble \nsubstances from the surface of the soil clods into the drainage/irrigation ditch (figure 4). Flushing raised beds with fresh water (water low in electrical conductivity and dissolved metals) two or three times before a crop is planted removes additional toxic substances that can affect crop roots and plant develop -\nment. Soil Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations \nare flushed with fresh water in annual raised bed systems that are submerged during normal flooding and then planted after the flooding recedes. The raised bed is rebuilt with topsoil after each monsoon flooding, then an annual crop is transplanted into the bed to grow; harvest occurs during the dry season with the cycle annually repeated (Minh et al. 1997a)\n Throughout the season, rain and/\nor freshwater irrigation consolidates and crusts over the soil surface in the raised bed, and mesopores form as crop roots grow and decay. This reduces the num-ber of water-conducting macropores and slows the movement of water through the soil profile reducing Al leaching (figure 5). Dry intervals increase Al\n3+ concentrations \nin the soil with infiltration after each pre -\ncipitation event removing some salts but at slower rates. When fresh water removes the Al from the soil it concentrates in the outflow to the ditch and can increase con -\ntamination in irrigation water downstream (Minh et al.1997a). Multiple-year, perennial raised beds with \ndeeper roots are built higher than annual beds (figure 3). Constructed from topsoil and sulfuric horizon soils while deepening ditches and clearing sediments during the dry season, the beds are left fallow during the following rainy season, flushing out Al and other salt concentrations. The use of the sulfuric horizon soil brings higher concen -trations of Al and SO\n42– to the raised bed \nand lowers the pH. After year 1 planting, development, bloom, fruiting, and harvest, the soil on the raised beds are not disturbed, and a perennial crop is grown on the raised bed for several years. The raised beds are 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 in) above normal peak flood levels so the crop is not submerged (Minh et al. 1997b).

What are some of the crops that are tolerant to high salinity and acidity in the soil, and how do they adapt to these conditions in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	The context does not provide specific information on the types of crops that are tolerant to high salinity and acidity in the soil in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, or how they adapt to these conditions. However, it does mention that there are ongoing efforts to develop salt-tolerant crop varieties and to increase crop genetic tolerances to aluminum and salt concentrations. These efforts are part of the strategies to adapt to the changing soil-water conditions in the region. The context also mentions the use of innovative land management approaches and extensive water management projects to make acid sulfate soils agriculturally productive.

Ngan et al.2018; Luu et al.2022).While Vietnamese Mekong Delta farmers have learned over the decades to manage flood-drought cycles in acid sulfate soils, the increasing instability in global cli-mate and local weather conditions present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges.The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS\n2 buildup leading to reduced \nagriculture productivity, degrades surface water quality, and makes aquatic ecosys -\ntems vulnerable (Tully et al.2019; Mosley et al.2017).A changing climate has altered the \npredicable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes and made it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops.Climate change, sea level rise, human land use management, increased population, and the rise in food and nutrition insecurity is again challenging the region to ratchet up their adaptation and agricultural pro -\nduction strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and that Vietnamese farmers are able to make a living.Local and indigenous farmer knowl-\nedge and university scientific research have combined to create innovative land man-agement approaches, engineer extensive water management projects, and develop salt-tolerant crop varieties to make acid sulfate soils agriculturally productive.Continuous research and experimentation will be needed to respond and prepare for present and future uncertainties.Adaptive integration of biogeophysical, \npedogenic, and social knowledge is critical in deepening understanding of landscape and local surface level drainage impacts and soil-water relationships under increas -\ningly variable conditions.Observing and learning more about the connections and synergies among rates of percolation, soil management effects on macropores and mesopores, the role of bypass flows in raised bed soil leaching processes, densities and types of beneficial bacteria in pro-ductive soils, and plant breeding for salt tolerance will be essential to living with uncertainty and strengthening delta sus -\ntainability and resilience.', '86A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4security and rural livelihoods (World Bank \n2022; Loc et al.2021).According to the World Bank (2022), Vietnam is among the world’s most vulnerable climate risk coun -\ntries, ranked 13th among 180 countries by Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index 2000 to 2019.In response to these changing condi -\ntions, the delta floodwater control system is being modified to encourage farmers to diversify their cropping systems and be more attentive to the environmental impacts of agriculture (Luu et al.2022).Vietnam Resolution 120/2017/NQ-CP , issued in 2017, promotes “living with floods,” “uncertainty adaptation,” and nature-based approaches for addressing climate change and upstream develop -\nment (Luu et al.2022).Delta farmers are challenged to make a living under these stressful and uncertain conditions.They continue to seek innovative water management and drainage approaches and adapt cropping systems to changing soil-water conditions, building on their accumulated local knowledge and sci -\nentific findings gained from laboratory and field experiments.Understanding the chemical and biogeophysical prop -\nerties and pedogenic processes of acid sulfate soils, developing climate-flexible crops and management systems as well as increasing crop genetic tolerances to Al and salt concentrations are foundational to effective delta agricultural adaptation.TRANSFORMING A LARGE TROPICAL \nDELTA INTO AN AGRICULTURAL \nLANDSCAPE \nFresh water for agriculture and drinking has for centuries been scarce during the long five-month dry season with saline water incursions making the acidic delta soils less productive for crops and the shallow ground water salty and not safe for cooking or drinking (Taylor 2014).Historically this wild, untamed, vast flood-plain was sparsely settled with agriculture and small settlements on marine sandy coastal dunes—fresh water oases—cre-ated as flooding and river sediments built out the delta.It was not until the French colonization (1800s) and Vietnamese state (1980s) undertook large irrigation pro -\ngrams to construct canals to channel fresh water from the Mekong and Bassac riv -\ners to reduce water and soil salinity that agricultural systems replaced the wetland ecosystem (Taylor 2014; Luu et al.2022).At first natural waterways were straight-\nened and deepened, and then connected by canals.The French Colonial Government set about clearing forests and draining wetlands to turn the underutilized and agriculturally unproductive soils into rice production.These sparsely populated, densely vegetated acid sulfate lands were used by resistance fighters as hideouts dur -\ning the US Vietnam War (1961 to 1973).After the war, the Vietnam state established large-scale state farms (1,000 to 10,000 ha [2,471 to 24,710 ac]) to increase the delta population and alleviate serious food shortages (van Mensvoort 1996).Newly resettled farmers were inexperienced in managing waterlogged acid sulfate soils to make them productive, and the state farms were inadequately funded with a shortage of knowledge and equipment resources as well as insufficient farm workers for large-scale parcels.Excess water on the landscape in monsoon season alternating with dry season freshwater scarcity made delta living conditions harsh, and most of these collective farms failed to grow enough food for farmers to make a living (van Mensvoort 1996).By the mid-1980s irrigation projects \nexpanded throughout the delta to create a freshwater network across the entire pen-insula with sluice gates that protected the waterway grid from saline intrusion and reengineered the waterscape to drain and control water for rice agriculture (Taylor 2014).Rice establishes and grows well in waterlogged environments but is sensitive to salinity with an electric conductivity (EC\nSPE) threshold of 3 dS m–1 (Korres et \nal.2022).The saline delta rivers, wetlands, and marshes were converted into peren-nial freshwater zones.This reduced the seasonal variation in water flow patterns, converted the flood plain into regulated canals, dykes, and polders that irrigated agriculture, and prevented annual flood waters from submerging fields (and sedi -\nments from replenishing soil fertility) (Luu et.2022).T oday’s Vietnam Mekong Delta agri -\ncultural landscape is built on managing and controlling the quantity and distri-bution of water year round (flooding, irrigation, fresh and saline waters) in allu -\nvial and acid sulfate soils (figure 2).']
What are the benefits of using purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) as a biofertilizer in improving plant growth and soil health in the Mekong Delta's acid sulfate soils?	Purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) have been found to be beneficial in improving plant growth and soil health in the Mekong Delta's acid sulfate soils. These bacteria release organic acids during microbial metabolism processes, which increase soil pH and make phosphorus (P) more soluble and available for plant use. PNSB application has shown to increase P availability, which is crucial for root growth, leaf and flowering, and fruit development. This has led to improvements in the growth, yields, and soil health of crops like mango, pineapple, and rice. PNSB solubilizing microbes are active in both aerobic and anerobic environments, making them well suited to the delta’s wet-dry cycles. The use of PNSB also reduces soil legacy P, improves fertilizer efficiency, and offers an alternative to synthetic fertilizers, potentially reducing the negative impacts of P loss on water quality.	['90A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4pest and disease resilience (Huu et al.2022; \nNguyen et al.2023).Phosphorus is insoluble (Fe-P) when \nsoil pH is less than 4.However, P solu-bilizing bacteria release organic acids during the microbial metabolism processes and increase soil pH.Evaluations of sev -\neral strains of purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) in the 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) layer of acid sulfate soil have shown that applica -\ntion of R. sphaeroides P solubilizing strains \nincreased P availability for plant use (Luu et al.2022).These bacteria solubilize Al-P and Fe-P compounds, making P avail -\nable for root growth, leaf and flowering, and fruit development.Mango, pineapple, and rice growth, yields, and soil health have shown improvements from the use of PNSB as a biofertilizer.PNSB solubilizing microbes are active in both aerobic and anerobic environments, making them well suited to the delta’s wet-dry cycles.Use of PNSB reduced soil legacy P , improved fer-tilizer efficiency, and offers an alternative to synthetic fertilizers with potential to reduce negative impacts of P loss on water quality (Luu et al.2022).Mekong Delta research on microbial \nbiopesticides for vegetable crops has shown capacity to improve pest, disease, and yield in green onions ( Allium) and an increase in soil \npH after two consecutive crops compared to the control (Nguyen et al.2023).A five-spice biopesticide product of garlic ( Allium sativum  \nL.), chili ( Capsicum), ginger ( Zingiber offici -\nnale), onion, and lemongrass ( Cymbopogon) \nresulted in significant increase in the number of soil bacteria such as beneficial N-fixing bacteria, phosphate (PO\n43–)-solubilizing bac -\nteria, and Si-solubilizing bacteria compared to the control.Stroud and Manefield (2014) found that \nActinobacteria was a major component of acid sulfate soil horizons in Australia.All soil horizons contained d-proteobacteria and a-proteobacteria.Splitting the phylum Chloroflexi into classes revealed that the Chloroflexi class was a dominate group in the acid sulfate soils, and the phy -\nlum Acidobacteria in soil horizons was dominated by Holophagae.The phylum Firmicutes was dominated by the classes Bacilli and Clostridia across all the acid sulfate soils, with the class Nitrospira low in abundance.This is the group that con-tains acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (Leptospirillum sp.), the most important \nphylotype in acid sulfate soils.The abun-dance of this group may be determined by pH due to their limited metabolic capacity (derives energy solely from Fe(II) oxida -\ntion) and adaptability under extremely acidic environments (pH < 4).Although little is known about acid-\ntolerant Fe(II) oxidizers, around 22 are acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing species across four phyla (Bonnefoy and Holmes 2012) with only Firmicutes, and Alicyclobacillus detected in these soils.Chloroflexus was \nhighly abundant in the acid sulfate soil horizons, but its role in Fe cycling is not well understood.However, research from microbial mat zones indicated a positive relationship to zones of enriched Fe(II) oxi -\ndation and the fully sequenced Chloroflexus aurantiacus (Trouwborst et al.2007).More research is needed to understand acid sul -\nfate microorganisms and roles they play in regulating plant nutrient uptake.IMPROVING PLANT SALINITY AND \nALUMINUM TOLERANCE \nSaline and freshwater wetland soils accu -\nmulate plant residues in the soil surface horizon and have a permanently sub-merged reduced gleyed horizon where Fe sulfide minerals (FeS\n2) are present \n(Ponnamperuma 1972).These anaerobic, submerged soils are neutral and can sup -\nport salt-tolerant plants.', '89A\nJULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL. 78, NO. 4 JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONAluminum-tolerant crops like pineap-\nple cultivar (Ananas comosus  [L.] Merrill), \na perennial fruit, tolerate low pH and high \nlevels of soluble soil Al, grow well in low soil fertility, and are fairly well adapted to acid sulfate soils ( Le Van and Masuda 2004). Pineapple roots are shallow, spread -\ning laterally 1 to 1.5 m (3.3 to 4.9 ft) and 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) deep, making it well suited for deep-ditch raised bed man-agement (figure 6) (Minh et al 1997b, Nga and van Meenvoort 1997). Pineapple has benefited from efforts to select plants with the ability to exclude Al from entering the root apex and root hairs (Le Van and Masuda 2004). Root elongation and color are two practical plant response indicators of Al toxicity that are useful to farmers in regulating field drainage in acid sulfate soils (Hanhart et al. 1997; LeVan and Masuda 2004). Saline-tolerant fruit culture (Loc et al. 2021), including Al-tolerant mango (Mangifera indica L.) and pineapple cultivars and salt-tolerant coconut ( Cocos nucifera L.) \ncrops, in delta soils are diversifying current cropping systems. \nMICROBIOLOGY OF ACID  \nSULFATE SOILS \nThe relationships among soil organic mat-ter (SOM), pH, microbial activity, and alternating aerobic-anerobic soil condi -tions are important areas of research for future crop adaptation. \nSulfate, a major component of sea -\nwater is reduced to sulfide (S\n2–) by \nmicrobial activity. Sulfide inhibits nitri -\nfication and denitrification (Tully et al. 2019). Soil microbes raise soil pH, drive SO\n42– reduction, break down plant resi -\ndues, and serve as an additional buffer to prevent acidification when the soil dries (Mosley et al. 2017). \nOrganic matter accumulates in fre -\nquently saturated soils with slower decomposition rates than when exposed to air (Tully et al. 2019). The presence of SOM regulates concentrations of Al by retaining the ions and reducing leaching (Nga and van Meenvoort 1997). SOM is the fuel that feeds microbial activity (and SO\n42– reduc-\ntion). When SOM availability is limited, soil microbial action slows or decreases. \nLow pH and metal toxicities inhibit \nplant growth, change the soil structure, affect the diversity of microorganisms, and impact plant available nitrogen (N), phos-phorus (P), and other nutrients. Nitrogen and P are critical nutrients in plant cell division, root development, and plant growth, and improve crop photosynthesis increasing plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Plant rhizosphere micro -\norganisms affect plant growth and yields (Huu et al. 2022). Beneficial bacteria have mechanisms that stimulate plant growth by increasing the availability of nutrients such as N, P , and silicon (Si) and improving Figure 5\nRaised watermelon beds, Vietnam Mekong Delta, December of 2022.

What are some of the ways that increasing plant available Silicon (Si) can improve the salt tolerance of crops grown in saline soils, according to the report?	Increasing plant available Silicon (Si) can improve the salt tolerance of crops grown in saline soils in several ways. It can enhance salt tolerance by facilitating improved seed access to soil water, improving the structure of leaf cells, and boosting photosynthetic activity. Solubilized Si can also help adjust water uptake by roots, which enables plants to maintain water balance and improve their drought tolerance. Furthermore, specific microorganisms can increase soluble Si, which can significantly enhance salt tolerance in some crops.	['However, upland plants have a greater variance in their resis -\ntance to saturated soils and waterlogging.This resistance has been linked to root capacity to oxidize the rhizosphere and ability to withstand short periods of soil submergence (Ponnamperuma 1972).When soil salt solution exceeds the \nosmotic pressure in plant cells, the plant has decreased root capacity to absorb min-erals like Ca, potassium (K), and water.High salt concentrations restrict soil water absorption and inhibit seed germination (Adil et al.2023).Salinity stress on plant metabolic pro-\ncesses affect osmotic processes, specific ion toxicity by disturbing the sodium (Na\n+)/\nCa2+ ratio, nutrition imbalance, and oxi -\ndation stress, which lead to decreased photosynthesis and plant productivity (Adil et al.2023).Increasing plant avail -able Si has been found to improve the salt tolerance of some crops such as rice, tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and sugarcane (Saccharum) grown in saline soils.A growing body of microbial research on Si applications is finding a small increase in soluble Si by specific microorganisms can significantly enhance salt tolerance in some crops including improved seed access to soil water, structure of leaf cells, and photosynthetic activity.Solubilized Si helps adjust water uptake by roots enabling plants to maintain water bal-ance and improve drought tolerance.One silicate-solubilizing bacteria (SSB) study on rice cultivars grown in salt-affected soil under greenhouse conditions in two consecutive seasons evaluated the efficacy of five SSB, Ochrobactrum ciceri TCM_39 (TCM_39), Microbacterium neimengense \nMCM_15 (MCM_15), Klebsiella aerogenes LCT_01 (LCT_01), Citrobacter freundii \nRTTV_12 (RTTV_12), and Olivibacter jilunii PTST_30 (PTST_30), isolated from \nbamboo, sugarcane, rice planted soils, earthworm intestine, and earthworm feces as bacterial sources (Nguyen and Tran 2023).Researchers found SSB improved rice salt-tolerant capability, growth, and yield when grown in salt-affected soils.Biochemical and physiological research \nevaluating salt and Al tolerance in pineapple cultivars is finding significant differences in detection of Al in the soil and accumu -\nlation of Al in roots among cultivars (Le Van and Masuda 2004).Low Al accumula -\ntion in roots accompanied by increased Al tolerance suggests an Al exclusion mecha -\nnism in the roots triggered by exposure to soil Al (LeVan and Masuda 2004).This type of research lays the groundwork for \nimproved plant breeding and technolo -\ngies that target development of plants with root systems able to exclude Al and mini-mize salt impacts on plant water uptake.These are the kind of innovations that \nwill be needed to simultaneously manage water-soil relationships in acid sulfate soils, improve agricultural capacities to pro-duce food and nutrition, enable farmers to make a living, and ensure the integrity of unique delta ecosystems.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', 'The depth to the acid sulfate hori -\nzon, depth to water table during growing season, the role of capillary rise, the spe -\ncific crop grown, and the time and cost of labor influence the height of the con -\nstructed raised beds.Evapotranspiration will pull water upwards during the dry season, potentially leaving behind Na\n2SO4 \nand other salts.The higher the raised bed, the thicker the zone of leaching will be and distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, thus increasing the available soil volume for roots.Freshly excavated soil deposited as \nridges or shaped into raised beds create a network of macropores between soil clods that enable water to flow through the top -\nsoil and bypass the unsaturated soil matrix.Water moving through the macropores of newly constructed raised beds can quickly Figure 2\nThis sluice gate in Soc Trang Province, Vietnam, connects a main canal to the \nSouth China Sea and controls saltwater tidal inflow and flooding outflow.Open sluice gates allow fields to drain after heavy rains and flooding and are closed during high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to irrigate agricultural fields.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation']

Ngan et al.2018; Luu et al.2022).While Vietnamese Mekong Delta farmers have learned over the decades to manage flood-drought cycles in acid sulfate soils, the increasing instability in global cli-mate and local weather conditions present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges.The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS\n2 buildup leading to reduced \nagriculture productivity, degrades surface water quality, and makes aquatic ecosys -\ntems vulnerable (Tully et al.2019;

What are the implications of intensifying saline water intrusion and drought in the Mekong Delta, as discussed in the report?	Intensifying saline water intrusion and drought in the Mekong Delta can have several implications. The intrusion of saltwater alters the soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. Drought periods can exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease, allowing saline water to move further inland. This can make the acidic delta soils less productive for crops and the shallow groundwater salty and unsafe for cooking or drinking. These conditions can also challenge delta farmers to make a living under stressful and uncertain conditions, pushing them to seek innovative water management and drainage approaches and adapt cropping systems to changing soil-water conditions.

"""What are the implications of saltwater intrusion on the soil chemistry of agricultural fields in the Mekong Delta, as discussed in the report?"""	Saltwater intrusion, which is the landward movement of saltwater, has significant implications on the soil chemistry of agricultural fields in the Mekong Delta. It alters soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. The intrusion of saltwater can exacerbate the conditions of acid sulfate soils, which are characterized by high concentrations of Al, Fe, and SO4 2– and low pH. This intrusion can be more pronounced during drought periods as freshwater flow rates decrease, allowing saline water to move further inland.

"""What are the potential impacts of salinity intrusion on agricultural productivity and biodiversity in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam?"""	The study by Vo Anh Nguyet and Son Ti Que Tran found that salinity intrusion has a negative impact on crop yield in the Mekong River Delta. Specifically, when salinity increases by 1 gram/liter, it reduces crop yield. Other research also indicates that saltwater intrusion can impact soil nematode communities in alluvial and acid sulfate soils in paddy rice fields in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Therefore, salinity intrusion can potentially affect both agricultural productivity and biodiversity in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam.

"""How has salinity intrusion affected agricultural activities and food security in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam?"""	Salinity intrusion has a negative impact on crop yield in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. The research showed that when salinity increases by 1 gram/liter, it reduces the yield of crops. This effect was studied using panel data collected from the Statistical Yearbook for the period 2010 – 2019, which included data on yield and area of rice, maize, sweet potato; salinity, river water level, average temperature, precipitation and total hours of sunshine. Various regression models were used in the analysis. This suggests that salinity intrusion could potentially threaten food security in the region by reducing the productivity of key crops.

"""What is the average salinity level in coastal provinces such as Cà Mau, Bạc Liêu, Trà Vinh, and Bến Tre, and how does it potentially affect the average yield of rice, corn, and sweet potato in the Mekong Delta region?"""	The context does not provide specific information on the average salinity level in coastal provinces such as Cà Mau, Bạc Liêu, Trà Vinh, and Bến Tre. However, it does mention that an increase in salinity has a negative impact on crop yield in the Mekong River Delta.

The yield of all three major crops in the region, including rice, maize, and sweet potato, also depends on the lowest river water levels or severe water shortages in the dry season, which reduce crop yields.

What are the alternative crops and soil management practices that can be implemented to supplement the loss of rice income due to the inland saline intrusion during the dry season in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam?	Alternative crops that can be implemented to supplement the loss of rice income due to the inland saline intrusion during the dry season in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam include familiar crops like maize and soybean, as well as novel crops such as quinoa and cowpea. These crops were identified based on factors like their salt tolerance, timing and efficiency of water use, ability to grow in the dry season, tolerance to pests and diseases, labor intensiveness, and marketability.In terms of soil management practices, methods like mulching, raised beds, and soil water monitoring can be used to decrease salinity stress and improve water use efficiency. Mulching with organic materials or plastic coverings can maintain soil moisture, reduce evaporation, slow capillary rise, and reduce the concentration of surface salt. Soil moisture monitoring devices can help producers develop an irrigation schedule that will improve water use efficiency and minimize the amount of saline water applied. These practices can help mitigate the impacts of saline intrusion and maximize the production of these alternative crops.

it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n9suitable alternative crop would have more green, less orange and min-\nimal to no red.This assessment framework highlights several potentially \nsuitable alternative crops including quinoa, cowpea and mustard greens, \ndespite the lack of a current market.A crop like soybean that has rela-\ntively poor salt tolerance and high-water use is less suitable despite an \nexisting market.It is important to note that various crops may suit \ndifferent regions of the MRD where water scarcity or saline intrusion \nmay vary (Tran et al., 2018a ).4.Alternative management practices \nImplementing various management techniques can provide a cost- \neffective way to reduce the effects of salinity and maximise production \nof dry season alternative crops.Conserving soil moisture, monitoring \nirrigation, and establishing effective drainage are well proven manage -\nment options that can be used in conjunction with a suitable replace -\nment crop.4.1.Soil moisture conservation \nImplementing management techniques that retain soil moisture can \ndecrease the need for frequent irrigation and, where the irrigation water \nis saline, reduce a crop ’s consequent exposure to salinity.This can be \ndone via the use of soil surface mulches or soil moisture monitoring \ndevices.4.1.1.Mulching \nMulching with organic materials is an effective way to maintain soil moisture (Abd El-Mageed et al., 2016 ), reduce evaporation (Fu et al., \n2018 ), slow capillary rise and reduce the concentration of surface salt \n(Song et al., 2020 ).Straw mulch is a cheap, biodegradable soil covering \nmethod that has been used by many producers throughout Asia to limit \nthe effects of salinity.The benefits of mulch in relation to soil salinity, \nsoil moisture and yield are summarised in Table 3.Plastic coverings can decrease evaporation, increase yields, decrease \npesticide runoff (Steinmetz et al., 2016 ) and assist with the adverse ef-\nfects of transient salinity (Barrett-Lennard et al., 2021 ).Plastic mulches \nare beneficial for increasing soil temperatures in cool climates (Lin et al., \n2016 ; Dong et al., 2008 ), however this is not an issue in the MRD.The \nmajority of plastic mulches are polyethylene based and non- \nbiodegradable, thus the environmental implications of using plastic \nmulch must be carefully considered (Kasirajan and Ngouajio, 2012 ).Research into biodegradable plastic mulches and microorganisms that \ndecompose plastic is still developing (Shah and Wu, 2020 ).4.1.2.Soil moisture monitoring \nFlooded rice production has dominated the MRD and thus there is a \nlack of knowledge regarding irrigation schedules for upland crops.Monitoring soil moisture throughout the dry season can help producers \ndevelop an irrigation schedule that will improve WUE and minimise the \namount of saline water applied.Tensiometers can be an effective tool to \nmonitor soil moisture and apply irrigation at the required time to \nmaintain adequate soil moisture, although they are not readily available \nto producers in the MRD.Successful monitoring of soil moisture in the \nMRD is dependent on affordable and easy to use devices.The Chameleon \nsoil moisture sensor is a cost-effective device that provides real-time, \nFig.7.A relative suitability scale for assessing a crops suitability as an alternative crop for growth in the MRD dry season using several physiological (salt tolerance, \nwater use (mm), water use efficiency (WUE), growth duration, temperature tolerance (Temp), pest and disease tolerance and socioeconomic factors (use of existing \nmachinery (Machinery) and existing market).Greater emphasis is placed on factors with larger circles.B.

Alternative crops that can be used in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) to mitigate the impacts of saline intrusion include familiar crops like maize and soybean, as well as novel crops like quinoa and cowpea. These crops were identified due to factors such as their salt tolerance, timing and efficiency of water use, ability to grow in the dry season, tolerance to pests and diseases, labour intensiveness, and marketability.In terms of management practices, techniques like mulching and soil moisture monitoring can help maintain soil moisture and reduce salinity damage to plants. Mulching with organic materials or plastic coverings can maintain soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and reduce the concentration of surface salt. Soil moisture monitoring can help producers develop an irrigation schedule that will improve water use efficiency and minimize the amount of saline water applied. Other practices like effective drainage and seed preparation techniques can also improve plant establishment and yield. These alternative crops and management practices can provide farmers with production options for saline affected areas during the dry season and income opportunities to offset rice losses.

it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n9suitable alternative crop would have more green, less orange and min-\nimal to no red.This assessment framework highlights several potentially \nsuitable alternative crops including quinoa, cowpea and mustard greens, \ndespite the lack of a current market.A crop like soybean that has rela-\ntively poor salt tolerance and high-water use is less suitable despite an \nexisting market.It is important to note that various crops may suit \ndifferent regions of the MRD where water scarcity or saline intrusion \nmay vary (Tran et al., 2018a ).4.Alternative management practices \nImplementing various management techniques can provide a cost- \neffective way to reduce the effects of salinity and maximise production \nof dry season alternative crops.Conserving soil moisture, monitoring \nirrigation, and establishing effective drainage are well proven manage -\nment options that can be used in conjunction with a suitable replace -\nment crop.4.1.Soil moisture conservation \nImplementing management techniques that retain soil moisture can \ndecrease the need for frequent irrigation and, where the irrigation water \nis saline, reduce a crop ’s consequent exposure to salinity.This can be \ndone via the use of soil surface mulches or soil moisture monitoring \ndevices.4.1.1.Mulching \nMulching with organic materials is an effective way to maintain soil moisture (Abd El-Mageed et al., 2016 ), reduce evaporation (Fu et al., \n2018 ), slow capillary rise and reduce the concentration of surface salt \n(Song et al., 2020 ).Straw mulch is a cheap, biodegradable soil covering \nmethod that has been used by many producers throughout Asia to limit \nthe effects of salinity.The benefits of mulch in relation to soil salinity, \nsoil moisture and yield are summarised in Table 3.Plastic coverings can decrease evaporation, increase yields, decrease \npesticide runoff (Steinmetz et al., 2016 ) and assist with the adverse ef-\nfects of transient salinity (Barrett-Lennard et al., 2021 ).Plastic mulches \nare beneficial for increasing soil temperatures in cool climates (Lin et al., \n2016 ; Dong et al., 2008 ), however this is not an issue in the MRD.The \nmajority of plastic mulches are polyethylene based and non- \nbiodegradable, thus the environmental implications of using plastic \nmulch must be carefully considered (Kasirajan and Ngouajio, 2012 ).Research into biodegradable plastic mulches and microorganisms that \ndecompose plastic is still developing (Shah and Wu, 2020 ).4.1.2.Soil moisture monitoring \nFlooded rice production has dominated the MRD and thus there is a \nlack of knowledge regarding irrigation schedules for upland crops.Monitoring soil moisture throughout the dry season can help producers \ndevelop an irrigation schedule that will improve WUE and minimise the \namount of saline water applied.Tensiometers can be an effective tool to \nmonitor soil moisture and apply irrigation at the required time to \nmaintain adequate soil moisture, although they are not readily available \nto producers in the MRD.Successful monitoring of soil moisture in the \nMRD is dependent on affordable and easy to use devices.The Chameleon \nsoil moisture sensor is a cost-effective device that provides real-time, \nFig.7.A relative suitability scale for assessing a crops suitability as an alternative crop for growth in the MRD dry season using several physiological (salt tolerance, \nwater use (mm), water use efficiency (WUE), growth duration, temperature tolerance (Temp), pest and disease tolerance and socioeconomic factors (use of existing \nmachinery (Machinery) and existing market).Greater emphasis is placed on factors with larger circles.B.

What measures have contributed to the increase in rice production area from 52% to 91% of the Delta area in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta?	The increase in rice production area from 52% to 91% of the Delta area in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta can be attributed to flood control measures, advancements in fertiliser use, implementation of mechanisation, and the adoption of high yielding rice varieties.	['Flood control measures (Marchand et al., 2011 ), advancements in \nfertiliser use, implementation of mechanisation and the adoption of high \nyielding rice varieties saw the rice production area increase from 52% to \n91% of the Delta area (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).A combination of climatic, \nsoil and hydrological conditions allow farmers to produce up to three \nFig.1.Map of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, its provinces, and its location within Vietnam (insert) (map adapted from Trieu and Phong (2015) .B.

What are the impacts of saline intrusion on agricultural production and farmer livelihoods in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	Saline intrusion in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) in Vietnam can have negative impacts on agricultural production, particularly on rice, which is a fundamental crop for the region. This can expose the economy of the MRD to risks, as agriculture accounts for approximately 40% of the regional GDP and provides livelihoods for over 75% of people. The MRD contributes to 56% of the total rice produced in Vietnam, providing income for up to 80% of the MRD population. Therefore, any reduction in rice production due to saline intrusion could significantly affect the livelihoods of these people. For instance, in 2019, paddy rice production was 0.6 Mt less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather. To mitigate these impacts, alternative crops to rice and in-field management practices are being explored.

What are the contributing factors to saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how have they affected the region, according to the provided context?	The contributing factors to saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta include the development of irrigation infrastructure in the 1970s, which created a link between the ocean and agricultural regions. The region's marginal elevation above sea level also makes it vulnerable to oceanic saline water intrusion. This vulnerability is further exacerbated by changes to upstream river flows and a changing climate causing rising sea levels, tidal influxes, and drought. Saline intrusion has been identified as the most prominent hazard to agricultural production for farming households in the region. It has damaging effects on agricultural production, farmer livelihoods, and economic stability. In response to the increasing salinity, the Vietnamese government made changes to the land use policy in 2000 to allow for diversification into rice shrimp farming along coastal areas. However, this led to rapid soil salinisation. Over 1.2 million hectares of the southernmost point of the Mekong Delta is now classified as salt-affected as a result of rice shrimp farming. Saline intrusion is also occurring in inland provinces traditionally not affected by salinity, impacting rice production and decreasing long-term productive capacity as soil salts accumulate over time. In 2020, parts of the Mekong Delta declared emergencies with drought and salinity affecting over 100,000 hectares of rice crop production as salt water intruded about 60-70 kilometers inland. It has been predicted that salt concentrations in 2050 will exceed 4 grams per liter up to 60 kilometers upriver from the ocean, subjecting inland areas to severe salinisation. To mitigate the effects of saline intrusion, farmers have varied the time of sowing based on seasonal predictions in an effort to advance crop development and avoid salinity damage at the critical stages of anthesis and grain filling.

What measures have been suggested to farmers in the Mekong Delta to mitigate the effects of salinity intrusion on rice crops, and what are some potential alternative crops that could be grown in the region?	Farmers in the Mekong Delta have been encouraged to adopt several measures to mitigate the effects of salinity intrusion on rice crops. These include the use of salt-tolerant rice varieties, earlier sowing dates, and management practices like mulching, soil moisture monitoring, and the use of drainage and seed preparation techniques. However, in areas where salinity intrusion is severe, farmers have been advised to limit rice production and instead grow drought-tolerant crops.

it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n4by the Consortium for Unfavourable Rice Environments (CURE) to \nencourage farmers to adopt the use of salt tolerant rice varieties to \nreduce salinity damage.In some areas including Ca Mau and Soc Trang, \nover 80% of households have implemented the use of salt tolerant rice \nvarieties (Paik et al., 2020 ) even though market prices for these varieties \nare lower (Manzanilla et al., 2017 ).Despite attempts to use earlier \nsowing dates and salt tolerant varieties as a method to reduce salinity \ndamage, substantial crop losses including complete crop failure have \ncontinued to occur (CGIAR, 2016 ; MARD, 2020 ).Rice grown in the Dong Xuan season is most susceptible to the effects \nof saline intrusion where salt stress effects the development and growth \nof rice.In addition, He Thu season rice is dependent on the onset of a \nsufficient wet seasonal break to leach salts from soil to a level acceptable \nfor the transplantation or sowing of rice.In response to the early onset of \nthe extensive saline intrusion event in 2020, farmers were instructed not \nto grow rice in areas that could be impacted by saline intrusion and were \nurged instead to grow drought tolerant crops (MARD, 2020 ).In the \nabsence of adequate research-based solutions to saline intrusion, \nfarmers in areas traditionally growing three rice crops a year have also \nbeen advised to limit production to two crops a year (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).To supplement the loss of income incurred from decreased rice \nproduction, there is a requirement for alternative crops with a higher \ntolerance to salinity and lower water use that are suitable for growth in \nthe Dong Xuan period.3.Alternative crops \nTo identify and successfully grow alternative crops to rice in the \nMRD dry season, criteria must be developed that encompass the suitability of a plant to fit into the production system.These include \nsuitability for growth in saline or water limited conditions, appropriate \ngrowing duration and correct temperature range for the Dong Xuan \nseason, tolerance to diseases and pests, an ability for the crop to be \ngrown and processed using existing labour, and the overall profitability \nof and market availability for the alternative crop.The complexities of \ncombining plant adaptation, with social and economic imperatives in \nfinding a suitable alternative crop for adoption in a rice-dominated \nlandscape should not be under-estimated.Whilst six alternative crops \nare investigated in this review, they are not the only options that may be \nsuitable, and thus emphasis should be placed on the method of identi -\nfying and determining alternative crops.This allows for assessment in \nareas outside of the MRD that may need alternative crops for similar \nreasons.3.1.Salt tolerance \nCrops have varying degrees of tolerance to salinity (Maas and Hoff-\nman, 1977 ; Steppuhn et al., 2005 ) and respond physiologically in \ndifferent ways to salt exposure (Greenway and Munns, 1980 ; Munns, \n2005 ).High salt concentrations cause osmotic stresses that impede the \nability of roots to take up water, and ionic stresses from absorbed Na+\nand Cl\x00can affect plants metabolic pathways (Munns and Tester, 2008 ).An additional important elaboration on crop physiological responses is \nthat waterlogging (soil saturation, an important soil constraint in Viet-\nnam) under saline conditions can increase Na+and Cl\x00uptake and \ndecrease K+uptake by crops, which can substantially decrease crop \ngrowth and commercial yields (Barrett-Lennard, 2003 ; Barrett-Lennard \nand Shabala, 2013 ).In the MRD, salinity increases throughout the dry \nFig.3.Maximum areas of the MRD affected by dry season saline intrusion with isolines in the rivers and water distributaries set at the threshold 4 g L\x001 \n(Figure adapted from Loc et al.(2021) ).B.

What alternative crops have shown tolerance to high salinity levels and could potentially be grown in the Mekong Delta region during periods of salinity intrusion?	Several alternative crops have shown tolerance to high salinity levels and could potentially be grown in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) during periods of salinity intrusion. These include salt-tolerant varieties of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), which can osmotically adjust by accumulating higher concentrations of Na+ in their roots during vegetative stages to minimize salinity damage. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) can withstand high levels of salinity due to its halophytic nature and efficiency in excluding Na+ from its leaves. In fact, quinoa has shown to have increased biomass and yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline conditions. Mustard greens (Brassica juncea) have also shown saline tolerance, associated with an increased sequestration of Na+ in roots. Maize (Zea mays) plants have been found to increase concentrations of proline, an osmoprotectant, in response to salt stress. However, the reproductive phases of maize are affected by salinity, leading to decreased kernel set and grain weight. Soybean, while having a lower tolerance, can increase photosynthetic rates in salt-tolerant varieties to generate greater grain yields than salt-sensitive varieties.	['Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n5season with canal water salt concentrations exceeding the 4 g L\x001 rice \nproducing threshold in lower elevations of the delta (Phung et al., 2020 ), \nsometimes reaching ~15 g L\x001 towards the end of the dry season (Eslami \net al., 2019 ).Rice will start to incur yield losses at 2 g L\x001 (Grattan et al., \n2002 ) and even salt tolerant varieties will suffer grain quality defects at \n3 to 4 g L\x001 (Qin et al., 2020 ).Consequently, plants that can either \ntolerate salinity during the reproductive stages of growth, or plants that \ncan be harvested early will be more suitable as alternative crops.Are there prospective salt tolerant crops for the MRD?Field trials of \npossible crops are just starting, but there are promising and notable \nalternative crops of whom demonstrate various cellular physiological \nmechanisms for tolerating salinity exposure.Salt-tolerant varieties of \ncowpea (Vigna unguiculata ) appear to osmotically adjust by accumu -\nlating greater concentrations of Na+in their roots during vegetative \nstages to minimise salinity damage (Le et al., 2021 ).The upregulated \nproduction of proteins involved in photorespiratory pathways also oc-\ncurs in cowpea plants exposed to salinity (De Abreu et al., 2014 ).Quinoa \n(Chenopodium quinoa) can withstand high levels of salinity due to its \nhalophytic nature and efficiency in excluding Na+from its leaves (Cai \nand Gao, 2020 ).In fact, quinoa has shown to have increased biomass \nand yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline \nconditions (Hariadi et al., 2011 ; Jacobsen et al., 2003 ).Characterisa -\ntion of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) involved in salt sensory \nmechanisms has occurred in quinoa (Maughan et al., 2009 ) with the \nplant demonstrating the ability to rapidly sequester salt into the vacuole \nto prevent the accumulation of cytoplasmic Na+(Cai and Gao, 2020 ).An \noverexpression of the SOS1 gene was also found in saline tolerant \nmustard greens (Brassica juncea) that was associated with an increased sequestration of Na+in roots (Singh et al., 2019 ).Proline is an osmo -\nprotectant that plays a critical role in counteracting osmotic stress and \nincreased concentrations of proline have been found in salt-stressed \nmaize (Zea mays) plants (Kaya et al., 2010 ).Whilst alternative crops have differing cellular physiological salt \ntolerance mechanisms, salinity also affects the agronomy and conse -\nquential yield in different ways.Seedlings are generally sensitive to salt \nexposure; however, seedlings of alternative crops are planted when soil \nsalinity levels are low.For this review, germination and seedling toler-\nance is irrelevant and will not be further investigated.Priority lays with \nan alternative crops ability to withstand salinity exposure during vege-\ntative and reproductive growth.Ultimately, the precedence is a crops \nability to produce marketable yield in a saline environment.Table 2 \nsummarises the yield response of alternative crop options at varying salt \nconcentrations including a relative ranking.Quinoa proves very salt tolerant and successfully produces grain \n(Hussain et al., 2020 ) at similar concentrations recorded in canals dur-\ning extreme salinisation events in the MRD (Eslami et al., 2019 ), whilst \ncowpea and mustard greens demonstrate high tolerance.The successful \ninoculation of cowpea played a significant role in the crops ability to \nwithstand increased salt concentrations (Manaf and Zayed, 2015 ).The \nreproductive phases of maize are affected by salinity with decreased \nkernel set and grain weight (Kaya et al., 2010 ) and consequentially, is \nranked lower than cowpea and mustard greens.Soybean has a low \ntolerance and ranks similarly to rice, although salt-tolerant soybean \nvarieties can increase photosynthetic rates to generate ~47% greater \ngrain yields than salt-sensitive varieties (He et al., 2016 ).', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n2Numerous biophysical, environmental, and \nsocioeconomic factors are identified that help \ndetermine an alternative crops suitability \nManagement practices including mulching, \nraised beds and soil water monitoring can \ndecrease salinity stress and improve water use \nefficiency \nCombining alternative crops and management \npractices provide farmers with production \noptions for saline affected areas during the dry \nseason RESULTS: Familiar crops in Vietnam (e.g., maize, soybean), as well as novel crops to the MRD (e.g., quinoa, \ncowpea) were explored as potential options to replace dry season rice.Management options including surface soil \nmulches and plastic coverings help maintain soil moisture and reduce salinity damage to plants, and the use of \ndrainage and seed preparation techniques can improve plant establishment and yield.Factors contributing to the \nsuccess of alternative crops include salt tolerance, timing and efficiency of water use, ability to grow in the dry \ngrowing season, tolerance to pests and diseases, labour intensiveness and the crops ’ marketability.SIGNIFICANCE: The identification of suitable alternative crops to replace dry season rice in saline affected areas \nof the MRD, combined with management practices like mulching and soil moisture monitoring, could provide \nfarmers with income opportunities to offset rice losses.Documenting the factors contributing to successful crop \ndiversification can assist with decision-making and support initiatives among farmers, agribusiness, and gov-\nernment agencies.1.Introduction: The Mekong River Delta and the central role of \nrice cropping \nThis review focuses on the increasing salinisation of the Mekong \nDelta in Vietnam and the search for alternative crops to rice.Focusing on \nthe primary bio-physical aspects, the review has sections on: the Mekong \nRiver Delta and the central role of rice cropping, saline intrusion, \nalternative crops to rice, and in-field management practices to mitigate \nthe impacts of saline intrusion.The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is in the south of Vietnam where the \nMekong River flows through a network of distributaries before reaching \nthe East Sea (Fig.1).The Mekong is the longest river in Southeast Asia \nand originates in the Tibetan Plateau before flowing through China, \nMyanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam;

What crops have high water use efficiency and can withstand saline conditions, making them suitable for growth in the Mekong River Delta during the dry season?	Crops such as maize, soybean, quinoa, and cowpea have been explored as potential options to replace dry season rice in the Mekong River Delta. Quinoa, in particular, is highly drought resistant with a low water requirement and can tolerate a wide range of temperatures. However, it's sensitive to waterlogging, which would require careful management. Maize and soybean, on the other hand, have higher water requirements which may limit their suitability for larger scale growth. Cowpea has been successfully grown in dry season conditions similar to those in the Mekong River Delta. Management practices like mulching, raised beds, and soil water monitoring can help these crops withstand saline conditions and improve their water use efficiency.	['However, the higher water \nrequirement of maize and soybean may limit the crops suitability for \nlarger scale growth as an alternative to rice.Another possible alternative crop is quinoa; this tolerates a wide \nrange of temperatures (5–35 ◦C) (Oveisi, 2017 ) and is highly drought \nresistant with a low water requirement (Algosaibi et al., 2017 ; Telahigue \net al., 2017 ).Whilst its growth is not common in Vietnam, it has been \nsuccessfully grown in conditions similar to the MRD dry season (Choukr- \nAllah et al., 2016 ).However, quinoa ’s sensitivity to waterlogging \n(Gonz ´alez et al., 2009 ) would require careful management following its \ngrowth after a rice crop.Implementation of raised bed systems might \nsuccessfully alleviate waterlogging issues (Bakker et al., 2010 ).Mustard greens is affected by heat stress (35/15 ◦C) at early flow-\nering stages although biomass production is unaffected at moderate \ntemperatures (day/night) of 28/15 ◦C (Angadi et al., 2000 ).Cowpea has \nbeen successfully grown in the dry season of Niger where temperatures \nFig.6.An overlay of dry season canal salinity concentrations (average of Soc Trang and Dai Ngai) with average monthly rainfall and crop growing duration for \nquinoa, cowpea, mustard greens, maize, soybean and rice (Salinity data from Ratering Arntz (2018) .B.

What alternative crops with shorter growing durations and tolerance to high temperatures could potentially replace rice in the dry season in the Mekong River Delta to mitigate the effects of salinity intrusion?	Quinoa, cowpea, and mustard greens are potential alternative crops with shorter growing durations and tolerance to high temperatures that could replace rice in the dry season in the Mekong River Delta. These crops could mature before the peak in salinity occurs, making them more suitable options.	['Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n8ranged from 31 to 44 ◦C (Oumarou et al., 2015 ).Alternative crops with a shorter growing duration like quinoa, \ncowpea and mustard greens that would mature before the peak in \nsalinity occurs may be a more suitable option as a replacement dry \nseason crop.Additionally, tolerance to the high temperatures that occur \nthroughout the dry season is essential for a plant to successfully grow as \nan alternative to rice.3.4.Tolerance to disease and pests \nDisease and pest susceptibility refers to the risk of a plant being likely \nto be affected by diseases or pests.This can have implications for yield \nand profitability and thus an alternative replacement crop for rice \nshould have a relatively low susceptibility.Diseases and pests can often \nbe controlled by integrated pest management (IPM) options involving \neither chemical application or biocontrol methods, although the cost for \nimplementing these must be considered when considering alternative \ncrops.High disease and pest pressures exist in MRD rice systems because of \ncontinuous cropping.Rice blast (Fukuta et al., 2020 ) and brown plant \nhoppers cause extensive damage to rice crops (Phan et al., 2010 ) and \nconsequently, farmers are familiar with the use of chemical control \nmethods.A farmer survey conducted in the MRD identified 64 different \nchemicals that were used in rice-shrimp farming systems (Berg, 2001 ).Of these, 25% were herbicides, 25% fungicides and the remaining 50% \nwere insecticides.The survey also identified a strong understanding and \nimplementation of IPM.Whilst an ideal replacement crop would have \nlow pest and disease pressures, the identification of crops that have well \nestablished knowledge regarding the management and control of \nprominent pest and diseases could also be favoured.Good environmental conditions exist for pathogen growth during the \nrainy season although conditions in the MRD dry season do not favour \nfungal spore development.Despite a lower disease pressure in the dry \nseason, the identification of alternative crops that have undertaken \nadvanced breeding through the selection of disease tolerant traits will \nhelp reduce disease impacts.Fungal diseases like downy mildew, stalk \nrot and sheath blights have been identified as some of the major diseases \nin Vietnamese grown maize (Sharma et al., 1993 ).Downy mildew is a \nprominent fungal disease in quinoa (Testen et al., 2012 ) with consid -\nerable yield losses incurring from infection (Danielsen and Munk, 2004 ).The breeding of downy mildew tolerant quinoa varieties have signifi -\ncantly decreased fungal impacts in these production systems (Colque- \nLittle et al., 2021 ).Soybean is also affected by fungal diseases with up to \n20% yield reductions occurring in plants infected with powdery mildew \n(Dunn and Gaynor, 2020 ) although breeding of tolerant Vietnamese \nsoybean can reduce disease susceptibility (Ho Manh et al., 2016 ).Powdery mildew has also been identified in Vietnamese Indian mustard \ngreens (Tam et al., 2016 ) with evidence of tolerance in Indian cultivars \n(Nanjundan et al., 2020 ), although more work needs to be done to breed \ndisease tolerant varieties in Vietnam.The combination of IPM and use \nvarietal selection may help reduce the losses or costs of production \nincurred from pest and diseases.3.5.Ability to be sown and processed using available labour \nFarm mechanisation has improved over the last decade in the MRD in \nresponse to labour shortages and developments in the availability of \nsmall farm machinery.Mechanisation reduces labour time and improves \nefficiency, however the equipment available to MRD farmers is gener -\nally specific to rice crop production and small farm sizes can hinder \nuptake (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).Ideally, alternative dry season replace -\nment crops would be capable of being grown using the same rice- \nproducing equipment already available to farmers, without major \nmodification, although there will be limits to this.Unlike rice which \nrequires anaerobic soil conditions (Rauf et al., 2019 ), alternative crops \nwill generally require aerobic soil conditions for growth.', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n2Numerous biophysical, environmental, and \nsocioeconomic factors are identified that help

the increasing salinisation of the Mekong \nDelta in Vietnam and the search for alternative crops to rice.Focusing on \nthe primary bio-physical aspects, the review has sections on: the Mekong \nRiver Delta and the central role of rice cropping, saline intrusion, \nalternative crops to rice, and in-field management practices to mitigate \nthe impacts of saline intrusion.The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is in the south of Vietnam where the \nMekong River flows through a network of distributaries before reaching \nthe East Sea (Fig.1).The Mekong is the longest river in Southeast Asia \nand originates in the Tibetan Plateau before flowing through China, \nMyanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam; it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.']
What modifications can be made to existing farming machinery to optimize harvest yields when transitioning from rice to alternative crops in the Mekong River Delta?	Minor modifications can be made to the header front, sieves, fan, and rotor speeds of the existing farming machinery to optimize harvest yields when transitioning from rice to alternative crops in the Mekong River Delta. These adjustments are made to suit each specific crop.	['Bed formation may become a critical part of field preparation prior to sowing for some \nalternative crops, particularly those with limited waterlogging tolerance \nlike quinoa (Gonz ´alez et al., 2009 ).In 2010, the use of mechanisation to \nprepare land in the MRD was 70% of rice farm production area and over \n60% of rice was harvested using a combine harvester (Takeshima et al., \n2018 ).The seeds of identified alternative crops can be sown via direct \nplacement into the soil, either by hand or implement.These crops do not \nrequire transplanting like rice, and this reduces one labour component \nfrom the system.For some crops harvesting can be performed using rice \nharvesters; approximately one harvester exists per 50 ha of cropping \nproduction land in the MRD (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).Minor modifications \nto the header front, sieves, fan and rotor speeds to suit each crop can be \nmade to optimise harvest yields.Processing equipment is common on \nfarm including mechanical corn shelling machines (Dang et al., 2004 ) or \ndryers for moist grain (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).Some identified alternative crops including maize (Rashid et al., \n2013 ) and soybean (Ho Manh et al., 2016 ) are already grown in the MRD \nwith farmers aware of the production cycle and labour required.How-\never, the production of other alternative crops in the MRD dry season \nwill be influenced by the successful adaption and use of available \nmechanisation (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).3.6.Profitability and availability of a market chain \nThe production of an alternative dry season crop must be financially \nviable for farmers.The shift from double- to triple-rice production \ninitially improved the profitability of rice monoculture systems in the \nMRD, but required significant increases in inputs, particularly fertilisers \nand pesticides.Over time, as the cost of these inputs has increased, the \nprofit margin of triple-rice production has gradually decreased \n(WorldBank, 2016 ).The cost of pesticides and fertilisers was recently \nestimated at 50–60% of total production costs in the MRD, while the \nprofitability of triple-rice systems relative to double-rice systems had \ndeclined significantly, with total yields in some cases less than in double- \nrice systems (Tran et al., 2018b ).Viability includes having an available market to trade produce.Farmers in the MRD are familiar with identifying new market chains \nwhen adapting to alternative farming practices, as evidenced by the \nimplementation of rice and shrimp farming (Dang, 2020 ).In addition, \nMRD farmers have already established market chains for some alterna -\ntive crops including maize and soybean.In a 2004 survey, farmers re-\nported that large quantities of maize could be sold via traders and \ncollectors from the farm gate which saved on transportation labour and \ncosts (Dang et al., 2004 ).Further opportunities for selling produce at \nvillage markets provides additional income to famers.An absence of \nmarket chain exists for crops like quinoa in the MRD, however the global \nquinoa market is rapidly expanding (Alandia et al., 2020 ) with over 120 \ncountries now growing it (Bazile et al., 2016 ).The identified alternative \ncrops are all directly consumable products for human or livestock and do \nnot require large amounts of processing like a fibre crop.This provides \nMRD farmers with the opportunity to sell directly to traders or con-\nsumers to maximise economic return.Export opportunities also exists, \nbut may require further development of relevant value chains (Otsuka \nand Fan, 2001 ).3.7.Overall suitability \nThe combination of factors discussed above contribute to an overall \nsuitability scale (Fig.7).This relative scale includes rice as a comparison \ncrop and can be used to examine the suitability of a range of different \ncrops not mentioned above or adapted for a different scenario or loca-\ntion.For the purpose of this review, greater emphasis is placed on a \ncrop ’s physiological suitability to the MRD dry season, as without the \nability to tolerate salinity or grow with minimal water, the adaption \nrequired to existing machinery or development of a market cannot \noccur.Using a ‘traffic light ’ framework such as that presented in Fig.', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n2Numerous biophysical, environmental, and \nsocioeconomic factors are identified that help \ndetermine an alternative crops suitability \nManagement practices including mulching, \nraised beds and soil water monitoring can \ndecrease

What are some of the benefits and potential challenges of using the Chameleon soil moisture sensor and effective drainage systems to manage soil salinisation in the Mekong River Delta?	The Chameleon soil moisture sensor is a cost-effective device that provides real-time information about a crop's soil moisture status. This sensor measures the water tension in the soil, eliminating the need to calibrate for soil type. It uses colored lights to indicate soil moisture status: blue for 'wet', green for 'moist', and red for 'dry'. This device has helped farmers in Tanzania to implement irrigation schedules based on quantitative data, saving significant amounts of water by reducing the frequency and duration of watering. It has also created social benefits among farmer groups by generating conversation and awareness of improved irrigation schedules. In the Mekong River Delta (MRD), the implementation of this sensor could limit soil salinisation by reducing the frequency of use of saline irrigation water.Effective drainage systems can also help manage soil salinisation. Salinity damage to plants can be minimised by removing excess saline water via effective drainage. Raised bed systems provide adequate drainage options for waterlogging sensitive plants and can help reduce the effects of salinity. In Bangladesh, a raised bed system combined with mulch produced significantly more potato tubers than flat ground with no mulch. The use of drainage pipes can also have similar benefits. Sub-surface drainage is known to remove excess saline water and helps reduce long-term soil salinisation.However, there are challenges to consider. The benefits of raised beds and drainage in reducing soil salinity levels are abundant, but their labour intensiveness must be considered when recommending their use in the MRD. Mechanisation is increasing in popularity in the MRD, but the availability of machinery may be a limiting factor.	['Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n10easily gathered information regarding a crops soil moisture status.The \nsensor measures the water tension in the soil which negates the need to \ncalibrate for soil type (Stirzaker et al., 2017 ).Three coloured lights \nindicate soil moisture status with blue as ‘wet’ (0 to \x0022 kPa), green as \n‘moist ’ (\x0022 to \x0050 kPa) and red indicates ‘dry’ (>\x0050 kPa) soil.Use of \nthe Chameleon sensor has allowed Tanzanian farmers to implement \nirrigation schedules based on quantitative data that saves significant \namounts of water by reducing the frequency and duration of watering \n(Mdemu et al., 2020 ).The adoption of the Chameleon has also created \nsocial benefits among farmer groups by generating conversation and \nawareness of improved irrigation schedules (Moyo et al., 2020 ).The \nimplementation of the Chameleon soil moisture sensor in the MRD \nmight limit soil salinisation by reducing the frequency of use of saline \nirrigation water.Used in conjunction with mulching and alternative \ncrops that have a high water use efficiency (WUE) and saline tolerance, \nthe Chameleon might provide a suitable management option for opti-\nmising the implementation of alternative crops in the MRD dry season.4.2.Drainage \nSalinity damage to plants can be minimised by removing excess sa-\nline water via effective drainage.Increased shoot Na+and Cl\x00concen -\ntrations can occur due to an interaction between waterlogging and \nsalinity (Barrett-Lennard, 2003 ).Waterlogged rice paddy may also have \nnegative impacts on the subsequent emergence and establishment of \nalternative crops sown at the end of the rainy He-Thu season.Raised bed \nsystems provide adequate drainage options for waterlogging sensitive \nplants and can help reduce the effects of salinity.In Bangladesh, a raised \nbed system combined with mulch produced ~70% more potato tubers \nthan flat ground with no mulch (Islam et al., 2018 ).The use of drainage \npipes can have similar benefits to raised beds (Feng et al., 2017 ).Sub-\nsurface drainage is known to remove excess saline water and helps \nreduce long-term soil salinisation (Smedema et al., 2000 ).Whilst the \nbenefits of raised beds and drainage in reducing soil salinity levels are \nabundant, labour intensiveness must be considered when recommend -\ning their use in the MRD.Mechanisation is increasing in popularity in \nthe MRD with a recent farmer survey indicating that one rotary tiller \nwith a walking tractor exists for every 7 ha of rice produced (Nguyen \net al., 2020a ).As an example of mechanisation, over half a million tractors were used in agricultural production in Vietnam in 2013 \n(Nguyen et al., 2016 ).4.3.Seed preparation \nSeed priming is a pre-sowing treatment that can help alleviate the \nnegative effects of salinity where seeds are soaked for up to 12 h in \nsolutions including NaCl, CaCl 2 and KCl prior to sowing (Chen et al., \n2021 ; Ashraf and Foolad, 2005 ).This simple technique has improved \ngermination, plant establishment and plant growth by initiating imbi-\nbition and activating metabolic processes (Ashraf and Foolad, 2005 ).Success across a multitude of crops has been reported with improved \ngermination rates in maize (Ashraf and Rauf, 2001 ), sorghum (Chen \net al., 2021 ) and quinoa (Yang et al., 2018 ).However, alternative crops \nin the MRD are planted at the end of the wet season when soil salinity is \nlow, thus seed priming is of less relevance.An alternative seed preparation technique that mitigates the nega-\ntive effects of soil salinity is the use of plant growth-promoting bacterial \n(PGPB) endophytes (Ali et al., 2014 ).', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n9suitable alternative crop would have more green, less orange and min-\nimal to no red.This assessment framework highlights several potentially \nsuitable alternative crops including quinoa, cowpea and mustard greens, \ndespite the lack of a current market.A crop like soybean that has rela-\ntively poor salt tolerance and high-water use is less suitable despite an \nexisting market.It is important to note that various crops may suit \ndifferent regions of the MRD where water scarcity or saline intrusion \nmay vary (Tran et al., 2018a ).4.Alternative management practices \nImplementing various management techniques can provide a cost- \neffective way to reduce the effects of salinity and maximise production \nof dry season alternative crops.Conserving soil moisture, monitoring \nirrigation, and establishing effective drainage are well proven manage -\nment options that can be used in conjunction with a suitable replace -\nment crop.4.1.Soil moisture conservation \nImplementing management techniques that retain soil moisture can \ndecrease the need for frequent irrigation and, where the irrigation water \nis saline, reduce a crop ’s consequent exposure to salinity.This can be \ndone via the use of soil surface mulches or soil moisture monitoring \ndevices.4.1.1.Mulching \nMulching with organic materials is an effective way to maintain soil moisture (Abd El-Mageed et al., 2016 ), reduce evaporation (Fu et al., \n2018 ), slow capillary rise and reduce the concentration of surface salt \n(Song et al., 2020 ).Straw mulch is a cheap, biodegradable soil covering \nmethod that has been used by many producers throughout Asia to limit \nthe effects of salinity.The benefits of mulch in relation to soil salinity, \nsoil moisture and yield are summarised in Table 3.Plastic coverings can decrease evaporation, increase yields, decrease \npesticide runoff (Steinmetz et al., 2016 ) and assist with the adverse ef-\nfects of transient salinity (Barrett-Lennard et al., 2021 ).Plastic mulches \nare beneficial for increasing soil temperatures in cool climates (Lin et al., \n2016 ;

What are some of the effects of saline conditions on the growth of different plant species, as mentioned in the report?	Saline conditions can have various effects on the growth of different plant species. For instance, the quinoa variety Utusaya maintained a higher stomatal conductance in saline conditions up to 12 g L-1 NaCl with only a 25% reduction in CO2 assimilation, compared to a 67% reduction in the salt-sensitive variety 'Titicaca'. Salinity at NaCl concentrations up to ~6 g L-1 mM did not affect the stomatal conductance of salt-tolerant maize plants, and the variety BR5033 maintained its leaf water potential at this concentration despite a reduction in root hydraulic conductivity. Cowpea was found to be tolerant of salinity-induced water stress by decreasing transpiration rates without significant adverse effects on yield. The report also mentions that the effect of salt concentrations on the yield response of various alternative upland crops and rice compared to their non-saline treatments was studied, with quinoa showing very high tolerance.

What are some of the potential strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of salt stress on crop growth and yield, as discussed in the context?	Several strategies for mitigating the adverse effects of salt stress on crop growth and yield are discussed. One strategy is to use salt-tolerant crops. For example, cowpea plants can osmotically adjust by accumulating greater concentrations of Na+ in their roots during vegetative stages to minimise salinity damage. Quinoa, due to its halophytic nature, can withstand high levels of salinity and has shown to have increased biomass and yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline conditions. Mustard greens also have a gene that helps them tolerate saline conditions.Another strategy is to use crops that have efficient water use. For instance, soybean and quinoa use less water throughout the growing season to achieve high levels of water use efficiency. Cowpea is more water efficient in the post-rainy season and more resilient to water-limited conditions. Maize's water use efficiency is improved when plants experience drought stress at the seedling stage.Finally, some crops can increase their photosynthetic rates under salt stress. For example, salt-tolerant soybean varieties can generate ~47% greater grain yields than salt-sensitive varieties.

\nsometimes reaching ~15 g L\x001 towards the end of the dry season (Eslami \net al., 2019 ).Rice will start to incur yield losses at 2 g L\x001 (Grattan et al., \n2002 ) and even salt tolerant varieties will suffer grain quality defects at \n3 to 4 g L\x001 (Qin et al., 2020 ).Consequently, plants that can either \ntolerate salinity during the reproductive stages of growth, or plants that \ncan be harvested early will be more suitable as alternative crops.Are there prospective salt tolerant crops for the MRD?Field trials of \npossible crops are just starting, but there are promising and notable \nalternative crops of whom demonstrate various cellular physiological \nmechanisms for tolerating salinity exposure.Salt-tolerant varieties of \ncowpea (Vigna unguiculata ) appear to osmotically adjust by accumu -\nlating greater concentrations of Na+in their roots during vegetative \nstages to minimise salinity damage (Le et al., 2021 ).The upregulated \nproduction of proteins involved in photorespiratory pathways also oc-\ncurs in cowpea plants exposed to salinity (De Abreu et al., 2014 ).Quinoa \n(Chenopodium quinoa) can withstand high levels of salinity due to its \nhalophytic nature and efficiency in excluding Na+from its leaves (Cai \nand Gao, 2020 ).In fact, quinoa has shown to have increased biomass \nand yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline \nconditions (Hariadi et al., 2011 ; Jacobsen et al., 2003 ).Characterisa -\ntion of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) involved in salt sensory \nmechanisms has occurred in quinoa (Maughan et al., 2009 ) with the \nplant demonstrating the ability to rapidly sequester salt into the vacuole \nto prevent the accumulation of cytoplasmic Na+(Cai and Gao, 2020 ).An \noverexpression of the SOS1 gene was also found in saline tolerant \nmustard greens (Brassica juncea) that was associated with an increased sequestration of Na+in roots (Singh et al., 2019 ).Proline is an osmo -\nprotectant that plays a critical role in counteracting osmotic stress and \nincreased concentrations of proline have been found in salt-stressed \nmaize (Zea mays) plants (Kaya et al., 2010 ).Whilst alternative crops have differing cellular physiological salt \ntolerance mechanisms, salinity also affects the agronomy and conse -\nquential yield in different ways.Seedlings are generally sensitive to salt \nexposure; however, seedlings of alternative crops are planted when soil \nsalinity levels are low.For this review, germination and seedling toler-\nance is irrelevant and will not be further investigated.Priority lays with \nan alternative crops ability to withstand salinity exposure during vege-\ntative and reproductive growth.Ultimately, the precedence is a crops \nability to produce marketable yield in a saline environment.Table 2 \nsummarises the yield response of alternative crop options at varying salt \nconcentrations including a relative ranking.Quinoa proves very salt tolerant and successfully produces grain \n(Hussain et al., 2020 ) at similar concentrations recorded in canals dur-\ning extreme salinisation events in the MRD (Eslami et al., 2019 ), whilst \ncowpea and mustard greens demonstrate high tolerance.The successful \ninoculation of cowpea played a significant role in the crops ability to \nwithstand increased salt concentrations (Manaf and Zayed, 2015 ).The \nreproductive phases of maize are affected by salinity with decreased \nkernel set and grain weight (Kaya et al., 2010 ) and consequentially, is \nranked lower than cowpea and mustard greens.Soybean has a low \ntolerance and ranks similarly to rice, although salt-tolerant soybean \nvarieties can increase photosynthetic rates to generate ~47% greater \ngrain yields than salt-sensitive varieties (He et al., 2016 ).', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n6protein content (Ghassemi-Golezani et al., 2009 ).3.2.Efficiency of water use \nA plant with efficient water use will assimilate more biomass or grain \nper unit of water.During the dry season in the MRD there are infrequent \nrainfall events (Dang et al., 2020 ) which need to be offset by the \nincreased use of irrigation water.Where this irrigation water contains salt, these salts can accumulate in the soils during the growing season.Alternative crops that have a high-water use efficiency (WUE) or low \nwater requirement may minimise the dependence on irrigation to \ncomplete their lifecycle.A plant ’s WUE is dependent on physiological \nprocesses, and anatomical and morphological adaptions that control \nwater movement (Liu et al., 2005 ).Decreased stomatal conductance will \nreduce transpiration rates, however there can also be decreased yields \nfrom concurrent decreased CO2 assimilation.A suitable replacement \ncrop will need to have elevated WUE without significant adverse effects \non yield.Fig.5 compares the WUE of a range of crops with potential for \ngrowth in the MRD.In general, higher WUE can be achieved with the \napplication of less irrigation water.Of the six crops listed in Fig.5, \nsoybean, and quinoa both use less water throughout the growing season \nto achieve the highest levels of WUE in this dataset (~8 kg ha\x001 mm\x001).By contrast, rice was a profligate user of water and had a far lower WUE.Cowpea was more water efficient in the post-rainy season and more \nresilient to water limited conditions that promoted high evapotranspi -\nration rates (Oumarou et al., 2015 ).Studies by Kang et al.(2000) show \nthat the WUE of maize is improved when plants experience drought \nstress at the seedling stage.These seedlings were better adapted to water \ndeficiency at stem-elongation and experienced no negative effects on \nyield.Similarly, the WUE of soybean was improved by incurring mild \nwater deficits before and after anthesis (Liu et al., 2005 ).The highest \nWUE for mustard greens was observed to be the treatment with rela-\ntively moderate water inputs (190 mm) compared to treatments with \nhigher irrigation (225 mm) (Kumar et al., 2020 ).Factors contributing to a plant ’s WUE are also intrinsically linked \nwith the physiological effects of salinity induced osmotic stress.Thus, \nWUE and a plant ’s ability to withstand saline conditions are often \nexamined together.The saline-tolerant quinoa variety Utusaya main -\ntained a higher stomatal conductance in saline conditions up to 12 g L\x001 \nNaCl with only a 25% reduction in CO2 assimilation compared to the \n67% reduction in the salt-sensitive variety ‘Titicaca ’ (Adolf et al., 2012 ).Stomatal conductance of salt-tolerant maize plants was unaffected by \nsalinity at NaCl concentrations up to ~6 g L\x001 mM and the variety \nBR5033 maintained its leaf water potential at this concentration despite \nthere being a reduction in root hydraulic conductivity (Azevedo Neto \net al., 2004 ).Cowpea was found to be tolerant of salinity induced water \nstress by decreasing transpiration rates without significant adverse ef-\nfects on yield (Düzdemir et al., 2009 ).Alternative crops with a low water use and high WUE are more suited \nfor growth in the MRD dry season to suit the minimal rainfall (Fig.5).The development and weakening of the monsoon system control the Table 2 \nThe effect of salt concentrations on the yield
