This reduces the flow in the delta and triggers salinity in trusion from inflowing seawater. I nsufficient flooding of the Tonle Sap \nflood -plain during the wet season can cause a serious salinity issue in the Mekong Delta during \nthe next dry season, showing a transboundary connection between the lower Mekong countri es (MRC, 2019).  \n The severe drought and salinity intrusion strongly affected 11 of the 13 provinces in the \nMekong Delta . Around  400,000 ha of cropland have been affected, of which 25,900 ha were \nleft fallow. Rice areas affected by drought and salinity intrusion rapidly increased from \n139,000 ha in mid -March 2016 to 224,552 ha by mid -April 2016. The Ministry of Agriculture \nand Rural Development ( MARD ) report updated on 15 April 2016 showed that 208,394 \nhouseholds lacked freshwater for domestic use. Water shortage and salinity intrusion also affected 13,000 ha of cash crops, 25,500 ha of fruit trees and 14,400 ha of aquaculture  (CGIAR, \n2016).  The Government of Viet Nam reported that more than 200,000 tonnes of rice were \ndamaged, resulting in a loss of over VND 1 trillion (USD 44 .64 million) to the Mekong Delta \nregion.  \n In early 2016, t he MARD reported that saltwater intrusion appeared two months earlier than \nprevious years due to serous river water shortage. In the winter- spring crop 2015 \u20132016, more \nthan 339,220 ha of rice in coastal Mekong Delta provinces were affected by saltwater intrusion and drought, accounting for  35.5% o f the rice -producing area in these localities and \n21.9% of region\u2019s total -rice producing area. Of the 339,200 ha, 104,000 ha were severely \nimpacted (Vietnamnet Bridge , 2016).  \n Leakage problems and sluice gate operation issues also contributed to increased  salinity in  \nthe canal systems. Farmers were already warned that the 2015 \u20132016 salinity  intrusion would  \noccur  earlier than usual.  \n However, at the beginning of the dry season in December 2015,  when salinity concentrations \nincreased in a short span, the sluice gates were not  immediately closed (CGIAR , 2016) . In the \ncoastal zone, the total area affected by salinity is about 2 million ha. To control salinity for \nagricultural production, embankments, dams, and culverts were  developed.  Due to the lack \nof sluices, temporary dams were  developed for salinity and water sources control. The \nmaintenance of the temporary dam system is very expensive every year.  \nFigure 10 shows salinity contours in the Mekong Delta in 1993, 1998, 2025, 2010, 2011 , and \n2016 under  natural conditions .

To enhance agricultural production, more than \n10,000 dams and weirs have been built throughout LMB, and many more are planned or \nunder construction.  Irrigation is a major consumer of fresh water , which accounts for 12% of \nthe average annual flow in the LMB . As a consequence , water flow in the Mekong and its \ntributaries has  decreased. Increasing demand for i rrigation  also impacts biology, the \nenvironment , and other water uses in transboundary basins in the LMB.  \nIn a\nddition, natural disasters significantly damage  agricultural production as well as food \nsecurity in the LMB. In particular, drought not only reduce s yields , but also prevents farmers \nfrom growing crops in the dry season. Flood s damage  irrigation structures , which suspend \nagricultural production in the  long term . Salinity intrusion also reduces crop yields and \ninterrupts  crop  cultivation due to soil salinization  over  a long period.  \nSome  irrig\nation projects in the LMB do not properly supply water  to the fields  due to improper \nproject management . Some water is not consumed for agricultural production and is released \nto public water bodies as dead flow, which  exacerbates  the drought situation and the salinity \nimpacts. In addition, low drainage capacity of irrigation structures  in the LMB  exacerbates  \nflood damage  to agriculture.    \nTo add\nress these issues, the irrigation system in the LMB needs to be improved, and a  clear \nengineering  guidance is  necessary for LMB  countries . Therefore, t he Mekong River \nCommission (MRC) has been implementing Activity 3.2.1.2 , \u201cIdentify opportunities, promote \nand provide guidance on irrigation development opportunities, for adaptation to climate \nchange, improved food security, and reduced inequity \u201d, since January 2021.  \nOne\n of the objective s of Activity 3. 2.1.2  is developing  a preliminary guidance for applicable \nirrigation techniques and technologies in the LMB with a focus on : (i) climate change and  \nnatural disasters ; (ii) the impacts of irrigation development , e.g. water level reduction in \nrivers ; and (iii) problems in irrigation project management in the LMB , based on  global \nexperience, the LMB context , and the local conditions of irrigation system s. \nThe Gui\ndance also indicates the  defects of irrigation techniques  and technologies being \nutilized in the LMB and suggests where improvements c ould  be made  for better utilization. It  \nshows techniques for planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance , and the \ntechnologies at  both the system and field level. Furthermore, the Guidance categorizes the \ntechnolog ies in three technological levels (low, middle , and high) so that the  MRC Member \nCountries  will be able to select them in accordance with their own irrigation development.   \nTh\ne MRC expects this Guidance to be used  by the LMB countries to mitigate the impacts of \nclimate change and natural disasters , address  problems in  the irrigation sector , and improve \nthe irrigation system s in the LMB .\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_name: mekong_river_2022_improving_irrigation_systems.pdf\n\n4 \n 2. IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT  AND POLICY  IN THE \nLMB \n \n \n2.1. State  of irrigation in the LMB  \n \nAll the MRC Member Countries  have plans to expand irrigation areas to increase rice \nproduction and its exports , diversify food production, and improve their food security and \nrural poverty. However, there are differences in irrigation expansion among the countries . In \nthe past 30 yea rs, in Lao PDR and Cambodia, there has been  low development of the ir \nirrigation sector s compared to Thailand and Viet Nam, which  had been rapidly developed \ntheir irrigation infrastructures until  the 2000s. Currently,  the total developed irrigated area in \nthe LMB is estimated at between 4.0 million ha and 5.0 million ha  (MRC, 2018b). The share of \nthe developed irrigated area at  present is shown  in Figure 1. \n \n     \nFigure 1. Current s hare of the developed irrigated areas  \nSource : MRC ( 2018b) \n \n \nThe total irrigation area in the LMB could nearly double in the long term, reaching up to 7 \nmillion ha. In these hypothetical plans, Lao  PDR, Cambodia and Thailand would dramatically \nincrease their developed area, whereas there  would be  very limited development in Viet Nam  \n(MRC, 2018e ).  \n \nA variety of irrigation systems have  been used for  rice cultivation in the LMB . Gravity irrigation \nwith open channel s is the typical irrigation system for most public schemes. Modernization in  \nthe irrigation sector has also transformed and upgraded some gravity schemes served by \npressurized pipeline systems. In addition to  the large public schemes, small- scale irrigation is \npractise d throughout the LMB. The combination of farm pond and  mobile pump is widely \nused by the smallholders practis ing subsistence agriculture (MRC , 2018 b). \n \nViet Nam  \n Viet Nam\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: \"What does the acronym LMB stand for in the context of the Mekong River, as mentioned in the report on improving irrigation systems?\"\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "LMB stands for Lower Mekong Basin."}]}

CONCLUSION  \n \nThe MRC expects that its Member Countries  will utilize the Guidance for reference when they plan \nnew irrigation projects  and improve existing ones . The Guidance shows  the techniques and \ntechnologies to address  the issues in the irrigation sector of the LMB.  \nThe MRC recommends  that its Member Countries  select and utilize the techniques  and technologies \nin accordance with their  level of irrigation development and the challenges that they are currently \nfacing.  \nHowever, MRC Member Countries  may need to test their selected methods and technologies before \nutilizing them nationwide. Therefore, the MRC  need s to conduct pilot testing of the  techniques  and \ntechnologies in the selected sites with the Member Countries , examine the effect s, and draft manuals \non them so that each  MRC Member Countries  would be able to introduce  them into their respective  \ncountry .   \nIn addition, the Member Countries  need to build  the capacities  farmers and local governments in  \nutilizing the methods and technologies based on the drafted manuals in order to disse minate them \nnationwide.  These manuals that  should be continually updated  based on findings and challenges \nidentified during implementation  for better practical use. \nThe MRC will develop the activities for practical use of the Guidance under the MRC Strategic Plan \n2021\u2013 2025 in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan. The MRC \nwill draft manuals of a few  techniques  and technologies selected by the MCs  and conduct pilot testing \nto examine  them  and build the MCs\u2019 capacities . Furthermore, the MRC will draft a policy paper based \non this Guidance,  \u201cPolicy paper on measures in irrigated agriculture to adapt to climate change and \nimprove food security \u201d.\n\npage_label: 16\nfile_name: mekong_river_2022_improving_irrigation_systems.pdf\n\n3 irrigation project management, water is overused for crop growth  and wasted as dead flow \nwithout being supplied to farmlands.

Conclusions\nBased on the SPI 1-month, SPI 12-month, and SPI seasonal drought patterns, it was\nseen that wet periods and drought vary by region (coastal, interior, and semi-mountainous\nareas). These were grouped into \ufb01ve clusters with comparable drought characteristics: two\nclusters in the interior region, two clusters in the coastal zone, and one cluster in the semi-\nmountainous region. According to the \ufb01ndings of the SPI season time series analysis for\nthe VMD, drought tended to worsen between 1980 and 2019 in both the summer-autumn\nand winter-spring seasons. At a signi\ufb01cance level of 0.05, there is a trend of increasing\ndrought severity, particularly in the semi-mountainous region (represented by the Tri\nTon meteorological Station). Similar to the interior and coastal regions of the VMD, the\nrepresentative stations (Can Tho and Cang Long) frequently face dry conditions during the\nSA cropping season. It should be noted that 42% of the VMD\u2019s land area is susceptible to\ndrought during the WS rice cropping season, which can be considered as a disadvantage,\nbecause at this time saline intrusion propagates deep into the VMD\u2019s rivers and canals,\ncoupled with low discharge volumes, as well as low rainfall.\nFurthermore, a relationship between rice yield and SPI was discovered for the SA rice\ncropping seasons. Our \ufb01ndings indicate that the yield of rice in the SA season will decline\nwith increased rainfall. Furthermore, we discovered a strong relationship between the\naverage rice yield in the VMD and the average yearly salinity (Smin and Smax) at the Vam\nKenh Station during the WS rice cropping season. Overall, the risk of reduced rice yields in\nthe WS rice cropping season is greater than it is for the SA rice cropping season due to the\nlimited rainfall and increased saline intrusion. Considering the huge impacts of droughts\nand salt water intrusion on rice yields, it is also imperative to undertake an analysis of loss\nand damages from an economic viewpoint in future works. Moreover, as loss of rice yields\nresults in substantial impacts to human health, both mentally, as well as physically, future\nworks should incorporate a nexus analysis incorporating the all important health elements.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.V .T.M., K.L., T.V .T. and P .K.; methodology, H.V\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the context, what are the differences in drought levels between the interior and coastal areas of the study area?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The interior areas of the study area tend to experience very slight to slight drought conditions.

This reduces the flow in the delta and triggers salinity in trusion from inflowing seawater. I nsufficient flooding of the Tonle Sap \nflood -plain during the wet season can cause a serious salinity issue in the Mekong Delta during \nthe next dry season, showing a transboundary connection between the lower Mekong countri es (MRC, 2019).  \n The severe drought and salinity intrusion strongly affected 11 of the 13 provinces in the \nMekong Delta . Around  400,000 ha of cropland have been affected, of which 25,900 ha were \nleft fallow. Rice areas affected by drought and salinity intrusion rapidly increased from \n139,000 ha in mid -March 2016 to 224,552 ha by mid -April 2016. The Ministry of Agriculture \nand Rural Development ( MARD ) report updated on 15 April 2016 showed that 208,394 \nhouseholds lacked freshwater for domestic use. Water shortage and salinity intrusion also affected 13,000 ha of cash crops, 25,500 ha of fruit trees and 14,400 ha of aquaculture  (CGIAR, \n2016).  The Government of Viet Nam reported that more than 200,000 tonnes of rice were \ndamaged, resulting in a loss of over VND 1 trillion (USD 44 .64 million) to the Mekong Delta \nregion.  \n In early 2016, t he MARD reported that saltwater intrusion appeared two months earlier than \nprevious years due to serous river water shortage. In the winter- spring crop 2015 \u20132016, more \nthan 339,220 ha of rice in coastal Mekong Delta provinces were affected by saltwater intrusion and drought, accounting for  35.5% o f the rice -producing area in these localities and \n21.9% of region\u2019s total -rice producing area. Of the 339,200 ha, 104,000 ha were severely \nimpacted (Vietnamnet Bridge , 2016).  \n Leakage problems and sluice gate operation issues also contributed to increased  salinity in  \nthe canal systems. Farmers were already warned that the 2015 \u20132016 salinity  intrusion would  \noccur  earlier than usual.  \n However, at the beginning of the dry season in December 2015,  when salinity concentrations \nincreased in a short span, the sluice gates were not  immediately closed (CGIAR , 2016) . In the \ncoastal zone, the total area affected by salinity is about 2 million ha. To control salinity for \nagricultural production, embankments, dams, and culverts were  developed.  Due to the lack \nof sluices, temporary dams were  developed for salinity and water sources control. The \nmaintenance of the temporary dam system is very expensive every year.  \nFigure 10 shows salinity contours in the Mekong Delta in 1993, 1998, 2025, 2010, 2011 , and \n2016 under  natural conditions .

Around  400,000 ha of cropland have been affected, of which 25,900 ha were \nleft fallow. Rice areas affected by drought and salinity intrusion rapidly increased from \n139,000 ha in mid -March 2016 to 224,552 ha by mid -April 2016. The Ministry of Agriculture \nand Rural Development ( MARD ) report updated on 15 April 2016 showed that 208,394 \nhouseholds lacked freshwater for domestic use. Water shortage and salinity intrusion also affected 13,000 ha of cash crops, 25,500 ha of fruit trees and 14,400 ha of aquaculture  (CGIAR, \n2016).  The Government of Viet Nam reported that more than 200,000 tonnes of rice were \ndamaged, resulting in a loss of over VND 1 trillion (USD 44 .64 million) to the Mekong Delta \nregion.  \n In early 2016, t he MARD reported that saltwater intrusion appeared two months earlier than \nprevious years due to serous river water shortage. In the winter- spring crop 2015 \u20132016, more \nthan 339,220 ha of rice in coastal Mekong Delta provinces were affected by saltwater intrusion and drought, accounting for  35.5% o f the rice -producing area in these localities and \n21.9% of region\u2019s total -rice producing area.

In the \ncoastal zone, the total area affected by salinity is about 2 million ha. To control salinity for \nagricultural production, embankments, dams, and culverts were  developed.  Due to the lack \nof sluices, temporary dams were  developed for salinity and water sources control.

This has led to the development of embankments, dams, and culverts to control salinity for agricultural production. However, the maintenance of these systems can be very expensive.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Salinity intrusion in the Lower Mekong Basin significantly affects crop yields and cultivation, particularly rice. Insufficient flooding of the Tonle Sap floodplain during the wet season leads to serious salinity issues in the Mekong Delta in the subsequent dry season. For example, severe drought and salinity intrusion impacted around 400,000 hectares of cropland in the Mekong Delta, causing rice areas to increase rapidly and resulting in significant damage to the rice crop. This led to a substantial financial loss for the region. \n\nWater shortage and salinity intrusion also impact cash crops, fruit trees, and aquaculture.

Aerobic lagoon s \nstore  wastewater in a big pond and purif y it by using microorganisms and algae  (Figure s 122 and 123 ).  \n  \n \nSince  aerobic lagoon s need  a large area to treat wastewater,  it is not suitable to do so when there is \na high concentration of  contaminants.  Since the se lagoons \u2019 aerobic microorganisms  and algae  \nphotosynthes ize, they need  a large area , according to the amounts of contaminants in wastewater. In \norder to reduce space,  an aeration system can be  installed in  an aerobic lagoon . However, aeration \nincreases the treatment cost because it uses  a great deal of  electricity.  \n  \nIn contrast, a naerobic lagoon s purif y wastewater through  anaerobic biodegradation and \nsedimentation in a large  storage tank.

For example, plants intake harmful substances  and water dilute s them ; soil conducts \nion-exchange adsorption ; and micro -organisms promote oxidation and reduce harmful substances.  \nWetlands need to modify topography around the sites. However, they are less costly than high -\ntechnology wastewater treatment system s because they purify wastewater through the bio-nature \nsystem. In addition, constructed wetlands do not need electricity to purify water.  \n Figure 122 . Lagoon with aeration (Thailand)          Figure 123 .

Low technology utilizes \nmetabolism and oxidation decomposition by microorganisms and small animals or diluting, sedimentation and levitation in a river, lake  and soil. Low technology  is generally  utilized  for: \n \n\u2022 Lagoons  \n\u2022 Wetlands  \n\u2022 Aquatic ( water plants ) \n\u2022 Contact oxidation  \n\u2022 Diluting by riverbed  water or water transmission by a river or lake  \n\u2022 Air exposure   \n\u2022 Aquaculture  \n\u2022 Sand filters . \n High technology is a combination of physical (sedimentation, filtering, screening and \nlevitation), biological (biofilm, airborne microbe, anaerobic digestion), and chemical processes (agglomeration, oxidation -reduction, sterilization, neutralization and ads orption). \nUsing essentially natural processes within an artificial environment, mechanical treatment technologies use a series of tanks, together  with pumps, blowers, screens, grinders, and other \nmechanical components, to treat wastewaters.  \n Biological treatment is widely used globally  because of its treatment efficiency and quality \n(JAR US, 201 2). In general, high technology may not be available in developing countries due \nto the high cost of installation and maintenance . \n The LMB has high pot ential for low technology wastewater  treatment because it has  high \ntemperature s throughout  the year , and the natural ecosystem is conducive  to self-\npurification.  According to the JARUS, wastewater treatment with low technology i.e . man -\nmade  wetlands  or lagoons, air exposure and aquatic , can be applicable in the LMB  (JARUS, \n2012).   Wastewater treatment with low technology applicable for  the LMB  (JARUS,  2012)  is shown in \nAnnex  5.  \n Recycle of wastewater and drainage water  \n Wastewater  and drained  water  should be reused  to improve  irrigation efficiency. Figure 80 \nshows an image of recycling wastewater and drainage water in an irrigation area and villages . \nWastewater in rural villages can be purified by a small- scale distributed sewerage system and \nthe treated water can be supplied to an irrigation canal. Farmers withdraw  water from an \nirrigation canal for paddy farming a nd then drain it to a drainage canal. A pump station at the \nend of an irrigation district pump s the drainage back to an irrigation canal for reuse.  \n In addition, this recycl ing system can also reuse irrigation water in the paddy fields of the \ndownstream side after treating the drainage water from the paddy fields in the upstream side.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are the two main types of lagoons used for low-technology wastewater treatment and how do they function?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The two main types of lagoons used for low-technology wastewater treatment are aerobic lagoons and anaerobic lagoons.

ISSUES OF THE LMB IRRIGATION SECTOR  \n \nThis section focuses on major issues of the LMB irrigation sector that need to  be addressed , \ni.e. the impacts of climate change, natural disasters  and irrigation development , and those \nregarding  irrigation project management in the LMB.   \n \n3.1 The i mpact  of climate change and natural disasters   \n \nThe LMB experiences  drought and flood almost every year. These natural disasters  not only  \nreduce crop production , but also damage irrigation structures  such as  dams, weirs , and canals.  \n Given the variability of rainfall throughout the year, many areas in the LMB are subject to \ndrought risk. The form of drought varies such as  in the onset of wet season rainfall, duration \nand quantity  of rainfall in different areas, the onset of the dry season, and the occurrence of \nperiods without rain during  the wet season. Areas with drought risk but insufficient irrigable \nland lacked  sufficient  water resources for agriculture  (MRC, 2018c ). \n Flash floods are frequent around Tonle Sap and in mountainous and hilly regions of the LMB. Pluvial flooding can occur on a localized basis across the B asin as a result of heavy rainfall. \nHowever, fluvia flooding is  the most important and potentially damaging form of flooding , \nand is the focus for the analysis here (MRC, 2018c). In particular, severe  flood  events  often \nbreak irrigation structure s, interrupt  the water supply to fields , and lower their storage and \ndrainage capacity .  \n Salinity intrusion in the Lower  Mekong Delta is known to extend more than 50 km inland \nduring the dry season, which affects  almost  2 million ha of land . Salinity is a serious constraint \nto agriculture , and rice yields are negatively affected by high salini ty levels (MRC, 2018c). In \nparticular, s alinity intrusion is a serious problem for Viet Nam, which is caused by water level \nreduction in the Mekong River or sea level rising, and deteriorates the  quality of drinking and \nindustrial water.  \n People in the LMB also fear the impact  of climate change on agriculture , because it  may \nexacerbate  the damages  caused by  drought, flood , and salinity  intrusion.   \n 3.1.1 Climate change  \nIt is widely recognized that climate change is a result of the influence of human activities increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Across the LMB, climat e \nchange is also evident with rising temperatures, changing precipitation  patterns , and rising \nsea levels above  the historical record.   \n The Mekong River Basin has already been influenced by climate change. The trends and step changes are evident in the 1981 \u20132010 baseline period, with conditions in the latter part of \nthe baseline period hotter and drier than they were at the start (MRC, 2017): \n \n\uf0fc Average annual basin -wide temperatures have increased over the historical record .\n\npage_label: 5\nfile_name: mekong_river_2022_improving_irrigation_systems.pdf\n\nCitation \nMekong River Commission.

This reduces the flow in the delta and triggers salinity in trusion from inflowing seawater. I nsufficient flooding of the Tonle Sap \nflood -plain during the wet season can cause a serious salinity issue in the Mekong Delta during \nthe next dry season, showing a transboundary connection between the lower Mekong countri es (MRC, 2019).  \n The severe drought and salinity intrusion strongly affected 11 of the 13 provinces in the \nMekong Delta . Around  400,000 ha of cropland have been affected, of which 25,900 ha were \nleft fallow. Rice areas affected by drought and salinity intrusion rapidly increased from \n139,000 ha in mid -March 2016 to 224,552 ha by mid -April 2016. The Ministry of Agriculture \nand Rural Development ( MARD ) report updated on 15 April 2016 showed that 208,394 \nhouseholds lacked freshwater for domestic use. Water shortage and salinity intrusion also affected 13,000 ha of cash crops, 25,500 ha of fruit trees and 14,400 ha of aquaculture  (CGIAR, \n2016).  The Government of Viet Nam reported that more than 200,000 tonnes of rice were \ndamaged, resulting in a loss of over VND 1 trillion (USD 44 .64 million) to the Mekong Delta \nregion.  \n In early 2016, t he MARD reported that saltwater intrusion appeared two months earlier than \nprevious years due to serous river water shortage. In the winter- spring crop 2015 \u20132016, more \nthan 339,220 ha of rice in coastal Mekong Delta provinces were affected by saltwater intrusion and drought, accounting for  35.5% o f the rice -producing area in these localities and \n21.9% of region\u2019s total -rice producing area. Of the 339,200 ha, 104,000 ha were severely \nimpacted (Vietnamnet Bridge , 2016).  \n Leakage problems and sluice gate operation issues also contributed to increased  salinity in  \nthe canal systems. Farmers were already warned that the 2015 \u20132016 salinity  intrusion would  \noccur  earlier than usual.  \n However, at the beginning of the dry season in December 2015,  when salinity concentrations \nincreased in a short span, the sluice gates were not  immediately closed (CGIAR , 2016) . In the \ncoastal zone, the total area affected by salinity is about 2 million ha. To control salinity for \nagricultural production, embankments, dams, and culverts were  developed.  Due to the lack \nof sluices, temporary dams were  developed for salinity and water sources control. The \nmaintenance of the temporary dam system is very expensive every year.  \nFigure 10 shows salinity contours in the Mekong Delta in 1993, 1998, 2025, 2010, 2011 , and \n2016 under  natural conditions .
