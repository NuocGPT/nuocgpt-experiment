This stored water can then be used for irrigation in the dry season by pumping it, thus helping to reduce the risk of flooding and also providing a reliable source of water for irrigation during times of drought."}]}

This is due to the advection from the buoyant inflow, which moves the density front farther downstream and reduces the entrainment (mixing) at the flood tide."}]}

At the district level, there is no significant relationship between poverty level and yield loss, but at the commune level, there is a highly significant relationship between direct impact and poverty. Poorer and more exposed communes show significantly higher rice yield losses in the event year. Additionally, rice yield losses are higher in poorer communes under similar salt exposure levels. This suggests that drought and saltwater intrusion can aggravate inequality, as the negative effects of exposure to salt are much stronger in poorer communes than in communes with a low percentage of poor households."}]}

This model can be used to simulate the different processes of salinization on a local scale, as well as to assess the water balance of the study area. Additionally, the model can be used to investigate the different processes of land subsidence in a delta, and to accurately assess the impacts of climate change and overexploitation on seawater intrusion."}]}

It also provides a framework for measuring social vulnerability and resilience to geophysical hazards, as well as the short-term impacts of natural disasters on consumption and poverty. Additionally, the assessment can help identify the most vulnerable populations and areas, and inform strategies for adaptation and resilience."}]}

The Stokes transport peaks by spring tide in both channels, driven by an increased amplitude of the semi-diurnal tide and its associated mixing. However, the Dinh An channel shows more event-like salt fluxes due to its larger depth and cross-sectional area, which leads to a larger spring–neap variability in stratiﬁcation. The total salt flux in the Dinh An channel is mainly downstream, driven by advective Eulerian transport, while the tidal straining term becomes an important factor during peak SWI events."}]}
