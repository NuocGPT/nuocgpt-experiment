Question	Answer	Context
What are the major threats to agriculture in the Mekong River delta in Vietnam due to climate change, and what are the most common agricultural adaptation strategies used to combat these issues?	Climate change poses significant threats to agriculture in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam. One of the major threats is the increase in salinity levels, which can reach a threshold that makes conditions unsuitable for rice production. This puts about 40% of the total rice harvest at high risk. Climate change is also expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, leading to a high reduction during dry seasons. Sea level rise, projected to range between 14-31 cm, could shift the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater and jeopardizing around 30,000 ha of rice land. This could result in an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.The context does not provide specific information on the most common agricultural adaptation strategies used to combat these issues in the Mekong River Delta. However, it is mentioned that climate change, sea level rise, and salt intrusion are complex and multifaceted problems, and there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation. Instead, there are many ways to address the problem on different scales.

Based on the context provided, what are the main crops grown in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and what are the major challenges faced, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and water management?	The main crop grown in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam is rice, with an annual production of 25 million tons on 4.25 million hectares of harvested area. This region contributes to over 50% of the national rice export. However, the Mekong River Delta faces significant challenges, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and water management. Salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m pose unsuitable conditions for rice production, putting about 40% of the total rice harvest at high risk. Climate change is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise, which could increase salinity in freshwater, put around 30,000 hectares of rice land at risk, with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

"""What are the potential threats to food security in the Mekong River delta in Vietnam due to salinity intrusion and inadequate water management as mentioned in the report?"""	The Mekong River Delta in Vietnam faces significant threats to food security due to salinity intrusion and inadequate water management. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which is unsuitable for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. This equates to a loss of approximately 9.86 tonnes of rice yield. Groundwater, an important source for municipal and industrial water demands, is also at risk. The Mekong River Delta has eight groundwater aquifers at different depths, and their levels and salt concentration vary depending on the season and distance to the coast. Climate change is expected to significantly alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Sea level rise projections range between 14-31 cm, and under the RCP 6.0 emission scenario, it's simulated as 25-30cm. This could shift the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. Under this scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land are jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta (2.3 million ha) are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons. These factors combined pose a significant threat to the food security in the Mekong River Delta.

Based on the context, what are the main challenges related to water management in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam due to the tropical monsoon climate?	The main challenges related to water management in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam due to the tropical monsoon climate include freshwater availability, which is strongly influenced by monsoon rain and upstream river discharge. During the rainy season from June to November, areas of the Mekong river below 4 m above sea level are exposed to floods and the river's discharge is 25–30 times higher compared with dry season flows. This leads to seasonal flooding of up to 1.9 million ha of land. Conversely, during the dry season from December to April, the Mekong River's flow rates drop to around 6% of monsoon season rates, leading to seasonal water scarcity for up to 1.5 million ha of irrigated land. Groundwater levels also drop by 2–3 meters and sea water intrudes into surface and groundwater resources, which further enhances seasonal water scarcity.

Tuan, Hoanh, Miller, & Sinh, ; Tuan et al., 2007).Freshwater availability is strongly influenced by monsoon rain and upstream river discharge.During the rainy season from June to November, areas of the Mekong river below 4 m above sea level are exposed to floods and discharge of the river is 25–30 times higher compared with dry season flows (Tuan et al., ; Tuan et al., 2007).According to \nTuan et al.() and Tuan et al.(2007) up to 1.9 million ha of land are sea -\nsonally flooded.During the dry season from December to April, the Mekong River has flow rates which are only around 6% of flow rates during monsoon season, leading to seasonal water scarcity for up to 1.5 million ha of irrigated land.Groundwater levels drop by 2–3 me -\nters and sea water intrudes into surface and groundwater resources, which further enhances seasonal water scarcity (Tuan et al., ;  \nTuan et al., 2007).2.1.3\u2003 |\u2003Ayeyarwady Delta\nThe Ayeryawady Delta in Myanmar covers an area of about 2 million ha and accounts for about 3% of Myanmars total area.It is character -\nized by a tropical monsoon climate with distinct rainy and dry sea -\nsons (Table 2).The delta is one of the most important rice-growing areas of the country as more than 50% of the total arable land is used for rice cultivation (Coleman et al., 2003; GRiSP, 2013; MOAI, 2015; Naing, Kingsbury, Buerkert, & Finckh, 2008).Myanmar is the sixth largest rice producer in the world, achieving \nan annual rice production of 26 million tons (GRiSP, 2013).Rice production is sustaining food security and plays a key role in \nincome generation and employment.82% of Myanmar's population is employed in agriculture (MOAI,  2015).More than 60% of the rice comes from rainfed production during \nmonsoon season (Figure 2), and only about 20% comes from irri -\ngated systems (FAO, 2002).The green revolution and expansion or improvement of irriga -\ntion infrastructure led to a shift in the use of cultivated varieties, use of fertilizers and crop rotations (Naing et al., 2008).However, the \nirrigation infrastructure is still poorly developed.According to the FAO (2012), Myanmar's total irrigation area increased from 1995 (1.5 million ha) to 2004 (2.1 million ha) by about 7% annually.All irrigation water comes from surface water (FAO, 2012).The Ayeyarwady is the country's most important river system, \nwith high variations in river discharge.As stated in Taft and Evers (2016), nearly two-thirds of the annual river discharge occur during rainy season, with the lowest rates in the dry season from February to March (Driel & Nauta, 2015).The river network is influenced by diurnal tides, and saltwater is entering deep into the delta (Driel & Nauta, 2015).The river system is natural and less man-modified as compared to the river networks of Ganges–Brahmaputra delta and Mekong River Delta.Only a few sluice gates were built in the lower delta to prevent the intrusion of saltwater (Driel & Nauta, 2015).As indicated by Taft and Evers (2016), research and information \non the Ayeyarwady river basin are lacking, in particular on current and future impacts of climate change and human interventions on water resources.3\u2003| \u2003THREATS\nAccording to the fifth assessment report of the IPCC, AMDs are ranked among the regions being most vulnerable to impacts of cli -\nmate change, which is mainly due to their specific geographic setting and low elevation (Clarke et al., 2015;

Based on the context, how does the seasonal variation in the Mekong River's flow rates contribute to saltwater intrusion and water scarcity in the Mekong Delta during the dry season?	During the rainy season from June to November, the Mekong River's discharge is 25-30 times higher compared to the dry season. However, during the dry season from December to April, the Mekong River's flow rates drop to only around 6% of the flow rates during the monsoon season. This reduction in flow rates leads to seasonal water scarcity for up to 1.5 million hectares of irrigated land. Additionally, groundwater levels drop by 2-3 meters during the dry season, which allows sea water to intrude into surface and groundwater resources, further exacerbating the seasonal water scarcity.

Minar, Hossain, & Shamsuddin, 2013).Assuming an average yield of 4.3 t/ha,\n1 salinity in this particular area jeopardizes 3.4 million tons of rice \nor 7% of the national rice production.According to the Soil Science Development Institute (SRDI) of Bangladesh, reported in Rabbani, Munira, and Saif (2018), over 50% of the agricultural land of \nBangladesh is degraded by saline water.In addition, the rate of salt -\nwater intrusion is increasing with an average increase of 0.74% and a total expansion by 1.06 million ha from 1973 to 2009 (SRDI (2010) in Jabed, Paul, and Nath, (2018)).As a consequence of uncontrolled groundwater abstraction \nand overexploitation, water pollution including saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, lowering of groundwater table depths, decreased flows of rivers during the dry season and possible land subsidence was described (FAO, 2011).High relative sea level rise was reported for coastal areas in \nthe Ganges–Brahmaputra delta as over 20 mm per year (Ericson, \nVörösmarty, Dingman, Ward, & Meybeck,  2006).Similar findings \nwere reported by Singh et al.2000, reported in Baten, Seal, and Lisa (2015)), stating a relative sea level rise of 4.0–7.8 mm/year in three different locations in coastal Bangladesh.Dasgupta et al.(2014) investigated current and future river salin -\nity for the southwest region of Bangladesh, using different emission and relative sea level rise scenarios (RMSL) (Table 3).Even under the best-case scenario (B1 and 35 cm RMSL), the \nresults indicate that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh by 2050.The authors further estimated a decrease by 11.1% and 29.7% of area suitable for agriculture in the best case and worst-case (A2 and 67 cm RMSL) scenario, respectively.3.2\u2003|\u2003Mekong River Delta\nLow annual floods during rainy season inundate up to 35% of the area (Tuan et al., ;

Vu, Yamada, & Ishidaira, 2018)).The extent of salinity intrusion is associated with rainfall, upstream water discharge, and tidal pressure (CGIAR, 2016; Dasgupta et al., 2014).', ""496\u2003 |\u2003 \u2003\u2002\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\n4,000 km of subchannels allocating freshwater to the fields (Tuan, \nHoanh, Miller, and Sinh (2007).About 20,000 km of dykes and sluice gates protect the area from flooding and saltwater intrusion (Tri, 2012;

What are the potential impacts of sea level rise and salinity intrusion on rice production in delta areas, and how might these conditions affect the availability of freshwater resources in the Mekong Delta?	Sea level rise and salinity intrusion can have significant impacts on rice production in delta areas. In the Mekong River Delta, if salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest is at high risk. This equates to a loss of about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield. Furthermore, climate change is expected to significantly alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, and under certain emission scenarios, this could lead to a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land, with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Additionally, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons. As for freshwater resources, the Mekong River Delta has eight groundwater aquifers at different depths, and their levels and salt concentration vary depending on the season and distance to the coast. Increased salinity intrusion due to sea level rise could reduce the amount of available freshwater for irrigation.

Taft & Evers, 2016).3.7% (about 56,000 ha) of the rice-growing area in the delta are affected by salinity (Swe & Ando, 2016).Starting with the end of monsoon in November sea water in -\ntrudes into the mainland up to 100 km from the coastline and then gradually decreases with onset of the monsoon (Swe & Ando, 2016; Taft & Evers, 2016).Rising sea level increase soil salinity levels and consequently lead to a loss of arable land in the coastal area (Seinn Seinn, Ahman, Thapa, & Shresta, 2015).As summarized by Oo, Huylenbroeck, and Speelman (2018), salt intrusion poses a year-round threat on coastal areas of Myanmar and thus, is classified as a major threat for agriculture.As development of water dams and hydropower upstream of the \ndelta continues, the amount of sediments reaching the delta will de -\ncrease and erosion will accelerate in coastal land at the river mouth.Currently, no hydropower dams are installed yet at the Ayeyarwady River, but many are in the planning stage (Taft & Evers, 2016).So far, scientific and peer-reviewed research on impacts of an -\nthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations on the water resources in Ayeyarwady delta are lacking, but are extremely ur -\ngent for planning future water allocation and management (Taft & Evers,  2016).4\u2003| \u2003ADAPTATION OPTIONS\nIt is widely recognized that climate change poses a threat to both, people and environment at different levels.In AMDs, the impacts of global change pose a threat to agricultural production, food security, livelihood and national economies.However, climate change, and also sea level rise and salt intrusion are complex and multifaceted problems.Therefore, there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation possible, but there are many ways to address the problem on different scales.', '| \u2003497\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nto sustain protective barriers.Deep penetration of saline waters in \nthe delta plain leads to rapid delta fringe expansion in those cases.” Moreover, relative sea level rise, which includes the subsidence of deltas, is accelerating sea water intrusion.Main consequences for deltas are seen in the inundation and loss of land area, and conse -\nquently, the loss of coastal environments with important ecosystems and ecosystem functions.Salinity intrusion in ground- and surface water will increase in intensity and extent, and thus, reduce the amount of available freshwater for irrigation (Jiménez et al., 2014;

"""What are the projected changes in river salinity in the southwest region of Bangladesh by 2050 according to different emission scenarios?"""	According to different emission scenarios, significant changes in river salinity in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh are expected by 2050. Under the best-case scenario (B1 and 35 cm RMSL), the freshwater river area is projected to decrease from 40.8% to 19.7% or 17.1%. Slight to moderately saline areas are expected to decrease from 35% to -30% or -21%. However, areas with moderate to high salinity are projected to increase from 8% to 17% or 27%, and highly saline areas are expected to increase from 35% to 38% or 40%. Under the worst-case scenario (A2 and 67 cm RMSL), similar trends are expected, with decreases in freshwater and slight to moderately saline areas, and increases in moderate to high and highly saline areas.

Kundzewicz et al., 2007).In the following, threats specifically referring to the individual \ndeltas are described:\n3.1\u2003 |\u2003Ganges –Brahmaputra Delta\nThe delta plain of the Ganges–Brahmaputra is prone to floods and according to the (FAO, 2011), “each year about 18 percent of Bangladesh is inundated during the monsoon season.” In a study, Mirza, Warrick, and Ericksen (2003) estimated the average area under flooding as 30% with a maximum of 70% during extreme floods.During the dry season, water scarcity and salinity are major con -\ncerns to agriculture.A reduced freshwater flow enables sea water, pushed by strong tidal forces, to intrude up to 200 km towards the inland (Dasgupta et al., 2014).With the onset of the pre-monsoon (late April), salinity levels in river decrease and finally drop with the onset of the monsoon end of May.Coastal areas are particularly at risk, with nearly 0.8 million ha or \n53% of the total area being affected by salinity (FAO, 2002; Minar, Hossain, & Shamsuddin, 2013).Assuming an average yield of 4.3 t/ha,\n1 salinity in this particular area jeopardizes 3.4 million tons of rice \nor 7% of the national rice production.According to the Soil Science Development Institute (SRDI) of Bangladesh, reported in Rabbani, Munira, and Saif (2018), over 50% of the agricultural land of \nBangladesh is degraded by saline water.In addition, the rate of salt -\nwater intrusion is increasing with an average increase of 0.74% and a total expansion by 1.06 million ha from 1973 to 2009 (SRDI (2010) in Jabed, Paul, and Nath, (2018)).As a consequence of uncontrolled groundwater abstraction \nand overexploitation, water pollution including saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, lowering of groundwater table depths, decreased flows of rivers during the dry season and possible land subsidence was described (FAO, 2011).High relative sea level rise was reported for coastal areas in \nthe Ganges–Brahmaputra delta as over 20 mm per year (Ericson, \nVörösmarty, Dingman, Ward, & Meybeck,  2006).Similar findings \nwere reported by Singh et al.2000, reported in Baten, Seal, and Lisa (2015)), stating a relative sea level rise of 4.0–7.8 mm/year in three different locations in coastal Bangladesh.Dasgupta et al.(2014) investigated current and future river salin -\nity for the southwest region of Bangladesh, using different emission and relative sea level rise scenarios (RMSL) (Table 3).Even under the best-case scenario (B1 and 35 cm RMSL), the \nresults indicate that climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in the southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh by 2050.The authors further estimated a decrease by 11.1% and 29.7% of area suitable for agriculture in the best case and worst-case (A2 and 67 cm RMSL) scenario, respectively.3.2\u2003|\u2003Mekong River Delta\nLow annual floods during rainy season inundate up to 35% of the area (Tuan et al., ; Tuan et al., 2007).Salinity is a persistent threat for \nagricultural production during the dry season.Tidal fluctuations push saline intrusion 40–80 km towards inland, and thus reduce water quality (SIWRR, 2010, reported in Tri, 2012; Vu, Yamada, & Ishidaira, 2018)).The extent of salinity intrusion is associated with rainfall, upstream water discharge, and tidal pressure (CGIAR, 2016; Dasgupta et al., 2014).']
What are some of the agronomic interventions and water management techniques that can be used to mitigate the effects of soil salinity in rice production in areas affected by climate change?	Agronomic interventions include the selection of appropriate rice varieties for the specific environment. For instance, salinity-sensitive rice varieties can be replaced by salinity-tolerant varieties, subject to soil salinity levels up to 3‰. Further research and breeding for salt- and drought-tolerant varieties with improved yields is also important. Despite their lower yields, the implementation and dissemination of less susceptible rice varieties should not be excluded in salinity adaptation plans. Adaptation options on the farm level include a shift to climate- and environment-adapted cropping cycles with adapted varieties. Farmers can also adapt to altered rainfall conditions by using cultivars with a shorter vegetation period. In areas prone to prolonged tidal flooding, traditional varieties with higher salt tolerance can be chosen.In terms of water management, it is an effective measure to mitigate soil salinity. Environmental and management factors determine the contribution of groundwater in the form of capillary rise to the root-zone. Water-saving technologies can reduce water requirements on the field and enhance system-scale water availability by shifting the water management scheme from a permanently flooded to a periodically flooded system. However, the choice of the appropriate irrigation technique requires careful assessment as it may be a fine line between saving water and maintaining low salinity soil levels. Water-saving technologies, such as AWD, also have the potential to reduce methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.

What are the potential long-term impacts of shrimp farming on soil salinity in the Mekong Delta, and how might this affect the sustainability of rice-shrimp rotational systems?	Shrimp farming, particularly in semi-coastal areas, can lead to soil salinization, which is identified as one of the major long-term impacts of shrimp culture. This increase in soil salinity can be problematic for the sustainability of rice-shrimp rotational systems. In these systems, rice is grown during the monsoon season and shrimp during the dry season under higher salinity levels. Ideally, the onset of the monsoon drains the field from salt, enabling field preparation and rice transplanting. However, due to climate change and expected shifts in precipitation patterns, this system can lead to a loss of valuable freshwater early in the season, as it is needed to remove the salt from the system. This makes farmers dependent on the intensity of the remaining precipitation, which can render the sustainability of this system questionable. Furthermore, the intensification and expansion of rice-shrimp cultivation can lead to an increase in salinity-affected areas.	['(2015) recommended a shift in agricultural produc -\ntion, mainly towards rice-aquaculture or rice-upland crop rotation for 180,000 ha in order to adapt to a 30 cm sea level rise.In rice-shrimp systems, rice is grown during monsoon season alternately shrimp in the dry season under higher salinity levels (5–40 ppt  \n(FAO, 1986).In an ideal world, the onset of the monsoon drains the field from salt and enables field preparation and rice transplanting.Indeed, shrimp farming was highly promoted to farmers in semi-coastal areas in recent years and farmers practising shrimp-rice rotational systems had on average 50% higher income than farm -\ners practising two rice crops (Anh, Kroeze, Bush, & Mol, 2010; Hossain & Hasan, 2017; Smajgl et al., 2015).In view of climate change and an expected shift of precipitation patterns, however, this system leads to a loss of highly valuable freshwater early in the season, because it is needed to remove the salt from the sys -\ntem (Christensen et al., 2013).As a consequence, farmers depend on the intensity of the remaining precipitation rendering the sus -\ntainability of this system questionable.In addition to effluents loaded with environmentally critical substances, soil salinization has been identified as one of the major long-terms impacts of shrimp culture (Ali, 2006; Anh et al., 2010; Chowdhury, Khairun, Salequzzaman, & Rahman,  2011; Clarke et  al., 2015).Therefore, \nintensification and expansion of rice-shrimp cultivation can lead to an increase in salinity-affected areas.Although the beneficial po-tential of diversified production is recognized, spatial-explicit suit -\nability as well as large scale and long-term impacts need to be assessed.Integrated water resource models describe hydrological \n\u200a3Parts per thousand.1439037x, 2020, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jac.12415 by Readcube (Labtiva Inc.), Wiley Online Library on [10/08/2023].See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use;

Ha et al., 2015).Climate \nchange is going to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons (Bui, Nguyen, Bui, Le, & Le, 2017).Projections for sea level rise are ranging between 14-31 cm \n(MONRE, 2016, cited in in Vu et al.(2018)), and simulated under the RCP 6.0 emission scenario as 25-30cm (Vu et al., 2018).The results from Vu et al.(2018) indicate a shift of the brackish water front (<4 g/L) further inland (50–60 km).Locations with a proximity of 15–20 km to the coast are estimated to have an increase of salinity in freshwater by 0.5–2.5 g/L and locations with a distance of 30 km are estimated to have an increase of 1–1.5 g/L.Under this scenario, around 30,000 ha of rice land are jeopardized with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes.Also Wassmann et al., (2004) concluded that around 60% of the Mekong River Delta (2.3 million ha) are highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.3.3\u2003|\u2003Ayeyarwady Delta\nFlood, droughts and salinity intrusion are substantial threats for the delta with an increasing trend over the last decades (MCCA, 2019;

Taft & Evers, 2016).Rising sea level increase soil salinity levels and consequently lead to a loss of arable land in the coastal area (Seinn Seinn, Ahman, Thapa, & Shresta, 2015).As summarized by Oo, Huylenbroeck, and Speelman (2018), salt intrusion poses a year-round threat on coastal areas of Myanmar and thus, is classified as a major threat for agriculture.As development of water dams and hydropower upstream of the \ndelta continues, the amount of sediments reaching the delta will de -\ncrease and erosion will accelerate in coastal land at the river mouth.Currently, no hydropower dams are installed yet at the Ayeyarwady River, but many are in the planning stage (Taft & Evers, 2016).So far, scientific and peer-reviewed research on impacts of an -\nthropogenic or climate change-induced alterations on the water resources in Ayeyarwady delta are lacking, but are extremely ur -\ngent for planning future water allocation and management (Taft & Evers,  2016).4\u2003| \u2003ADAPTATION OPTIONS\nIt is widely recognized that climate change poses a threat to both, people and environment at different levels.In AMDs, the impacts of global change pose a threat to agricultural production, food security, livelihood and national economies.However, climate change, and also sea level rise and salt intrusion are complex and multifaceted problems.Therefore, there is no single solution for adaptation or mitigation possible, but there are many ways to address the problem on different scales.']
What are the potential impacts of alterations in freshwater availability and seawater intrusion induced by climate change on rice production in the Mekong Delta, as discussed in the report?	The report discusses that climate change and seawater intrusion could have significant impacts on rice production in the Mekong Delta. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta, or about 9.86 tonnes of rice yield, are at high risk. Groundwater levels and their salt concentration, which are important for rice production, can vary depending on the season and distance to the coast. Climate change is expected to significantly alter groundwater recharge, particularly reducing it during dry seasons. Sea level rise projections range between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land, leading to an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta (2.3 million ha) are highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

"""What are the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater resources and rice production in the Mekong Delta, according to the report by Schneider and Asch?"""	Climate change can lead to saltwater intrusion and sea level rise, which can significantly impact freshwater resources in the Mekong Delta. This can, in turn, affect rice production, as rice cultivation requires a substantial amount of freshwater. Additionally, changes in the flood season due to rising water levels can also have implications for rice production. Methane emissions from rice cultivation in different agro-ecological zones of the Mekong river delta can also be influenced by climate change.	['| \u2003503\nSCHNEIDER aND aSCH\nThanh, N. C.

What are the potential impacts of floods, salinity intrusion, and climate change on rice production in the Mekong River Delta, as discussed in the report?	The report discusses several potential impacts of floods, salinity intrusion, and climate change on rice production in the Mekong River Delta. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. Climate change is expected to significantly alter groundwater recharge, with a high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, which could shift the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land, with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Additionally, about 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

What are the potential impacts of climate change, specifically rising sea levels, on rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	Rising sea levels due to climate change can have significant impacts on rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. If salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m, which are unsuitable conditions for rice production, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. Climate change is also expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, leading to an increase in salinity in freshwater at various locations. This could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

Based on the provided context, what are the potential impacts of coastal salinity on rice production as studied in the Ayeyarwady Region, Myanmar, and how might these findings be relevant to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	Coastal salinity poses a significant threat to rice production in the Ayeyarwady Region, Myanmar. Salinity intrusion is a year-round threat on coastal areas of Myanmar and is classified as a major threat for agriculture. Rising sea levels increase soil salinity levels, leading to a loss of arable land in the coastal area. This is particularly concerning as the Ayeyarwady Delta is one of the most important rice-growing areas of the country, with more than 50% of the total arable land used for rice cultivation.In the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, similar issues are observed. Salinity levels reaching a threshold of 4 ds/m pose unsuitable conditions for rice production. Under such conditions, about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta is at high risk. Climate change is expected to substantially alter groundwater recharge, with high reduction during dry seasons. Projections for sea level rise indicate a shift of the brackish water front further inland, increasing salinity in freshwater at various locations. This scenario jeopardizes around 30,000 ha of rice land with an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Therefore, the findings from the Ayeyarwady Region could be relevant to the Mekong Delta as both regions face similar threats from rising salinity levels due to climate change and sea level rise. These findings could help in planning future water allocation and management in both regions.

Tuan, Hoanh, Miller, & Sinh, ; Tuan et al., 2007).Freshwater availability is strongly influenced by monsoon rain and upstream river discharge.During the rainy season from June to November, areas of the Mekong river below 4 m above sea level are exposed to floods and discharge of the river is 25–30 times higher compared with dry season flows (Tuan et al., ; Tuan et al., 2007).According to \nTuan et al.() and Tuan et al.(2007) up to 1.9 million ha of land are sea -\nsonally flooded.During the dry season from December to April, the Mekong River has flow rates which are only around 6% of flow rates during monsoon season, leading to seasonal water scarcity for up to 1.5 million ha of irrigated land.Groundwater levels drop by 2–3 me -\nters and sea water intrudes into surface and groundwater resources, which further enhances seasonal water scarcity (Tuan et al., ;  \nTuan et al., 2007).2.1.3\u2003 |\u2003Ayeyarwady Delta\nThe Ayeryawady Delta in Myanmar covers an area of about 2 million ha and accounts for about 3% of Myanmars total area.It is character -\nized by a tropical monsoon climate with distinct rainy and dry sea -\nsons (Table 2).The delta is one of the most important rice-growing areas of the country as more than 50% of the total arable land is used for rice cultivation (Coleman et al., 2003; GRiSP, 2013; MOAI, 2015; Naing, Kingsbury, Buerkert, & Finckh, 2008).Myanmar is the sixth largest rice producer in the world, achieving \nan annual rice production of 26 million tons (GRiSP, 2013).Rice production is sustaining food security and plays a key role in \nincome generation and employment.82% of Myanmar's population is employed in agriculture (MOAI,  2015).More than 60% of the rice comes from rainfed production during \nmonsoon season (Figure 2), and only about 20% comes from irri -\ngated systems (FAO, 2002).The green revolution and expansion or improvement of irriga -\ntion infrastructure led to a shift in the use of cultivated varieties, use of fertilizers and crop rotations (Naing et al., 2008).However, the \nirrigation infrastructure is still poorly developed.According to the FAO (2012), Myanmar's total irrigation area increased from 1995 (1.5 million ha) to 2004 (2.1 million ha) by about 7% annually.All irrigation water comes from surface water (FAO, 2012).The Ayeyarwady is the country's most important river system, \nwith high variations in river discharge.As stated in Taft and Evers (2016), nearly two-thirds of the annual river discharge occur during rainy season, with the lowest rates in the dry season from February to March (Driel & Nauta, 2015).The river network is influenced by diurnal tides, and saltwater is entering deep into the delta (Driel & Nauta, 2015).The river system is natural and less man-modified as compared to the river networks of Ganges–Brahmaputra delta and Mekong River Delta.Only a few sluice gates were built in the lower delta to prevent the intrusion of saltwater (Driel & Nauta, 2015).As indicated by Taft and Evers (2016), research and information \non the Ayeyarwady river basin are lacking, in particular on current and future impacts of climate change and human interventions on water resources.3\u2003| \u2003THREATS\nAccording to the fifth assessment report of the IPCC, AMDs are ranked among the regions being most vulnerable to impacts of cli -\nmate change, which is mainly due to their specific geographic setting and low elevation (Clarke et al., 2015; Cruz et al., 2007).Global climate change and an increase of interventions in natural \nstreamflow interrupt the natural balance of fresh- and saltwater, as well as sedimentation load.Thus, freshwater scarcity and erosion are major threats for tidal influenced deltas.""]"
What are the potential impacts of sea level rise due to climate change on seawater intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and how might this affect rice production?	Sea level rise due to climate change is projected to significantly alter the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. It's expected to increase the salinity levels in the groundwater, which can pose unsuitable conditions for rice production if the salinity levels reach a threshold of 4 ds/m. This could put about 40% of the total rice harvest of the Mekong River Delta at high risk. Projections for sea level rise range between 14-31 cm, and under certain emission scenarios, this could lead to a shift of the brackish water front further inland. Locations close to the coast are estimated to have an increase in salinity in freshwater, which could jeopardize around 30,000 ha of rice land and lead to an estimated annual yield loss of 240,000 tonnes. Furthermore, around 60% of the Mekong River Delta is highly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise in future wet seasons.

"""How have anthropogenic developments and natural hazards interacted to increase saltwater intrusion and decrease rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, according to the report?"""	Anthropogenic developments and natural hazards have interacted in several ways to increase saltwater intrusion and decrease rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. High agrochemical inputs have been used to maximize rice yields despite a smaller growing area, but excessive use can affect rice quality and increase the prevalence of pests and diseases. Developments meant to improve agricultural productivity or economic growth, such as dikes, can create environmental consequences. Dikes keep floodwaters and salt intrusion out, but they also reduce fertile silt deposits. Sand mining and upstream dams, while intended to aid in development, increase channel erosion and reduce the frequency of natural freshwater flooding. They also affect sediment accumulation as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream. Groundwater extraction, another human activity, causes land subsidence, saltwater intrusion, and arsenic contamination, negatively impacting rice growing areas and rice quality. Natural hazards like typhoons and sea level rise can induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion. Droughts can also worsen the extent of salinity intrusion due to a lack of fresh water. Climate change may exacerbate these effects by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters. In the Mekong Delta specifically, high dikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are unique issues. Typhoons are less common in the Mekong River Delta, but when they do occur, they tend to affect coastal provinces more than those farther inland. Overall, the reduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams, coupled with land subsidence from groundwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce rice growing areas in the future.

Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M.

Based on the report, how does the vulnerability of the Mekong River Delta to environmental hazards impact agricultural production in the region?	The vulnerability of the Mekong River Delta to environmental hazards has significant impacts on agricultural production in the region. Natural hazards such as typhoons, floods, and droughts can cause substantial damage to crops, particularly rice, which is a staple food and key export crop for Vietnam. For instance, typhoons can damage rice crops with strong winds and flooding from heavy rain, especially if they occur during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods. Floods, often caused by heavy monsoonal rains, can also damage crops, although moderate levels of freshwater flooding may be beneficial to agricultural production. Droughts, while uncommon, have caused significant economic loss, particularly in the agriculture sector. The 2015-2016 drought, for example, affected all the Mekong River Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 million in damage, with USD 300 million being agriculture- and aquaculture-related damage. In addition to natural hazards, anthropogenic factors also impact agricultural production. Changes in land use, driven by higher prices and rising demand for aquaculture and non-rice products, have led farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to embrace non-rice crops. Environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion has also reduced rice growing areas. Furthermore, the construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields, but these dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Other anthropogenic factors, such as sand mining and upstream dam construction, can reduce sediment availability and increase channel erosion, which can negatively impact agricultural productivity.

How has worsening saltwater intrusion affected rice production in the Mekong Delta, and what alternative crops are farmers turning to in response to this issue?	The context does not provide specific information on how worsening saltwater intrusion has affected rice production in the Mekong Delta, nor does it mention what alternative crops farmers are turning to in response to this issue.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities;

Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021']
"""How does the systems-thinking approach help in understanding the interdependent nature of anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers and their impact on rice production in the Mekong River Delta?"""	The systems-thinking approach helps by providing an overarching picture of how anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers interact to either reinforce or diminish rice production. It integrates the different drivers of anthropogenic change and natural hazards to show their interrelated and interdependent nature, and how the processes associated with each driver affect rice growing areas, rice production, and rice quality. This approach is particularly useful in dealing with the complex environmental problems present in the deltas of Vietnam, which are caused by a range of interdependent anthropogenic and natural hazards drivers operating at multiple scales. The systems-thinking approach also allows these multitude of drivers and environmental processes to be visualized and mapped in a way that is easy to understand, which is crucial for policymakers and managers in addressing these issues.	['On a more technical level,\nChapman and Darby (2016) used system dynamics modeling\nto simulate the delays, feedbacks and tipping points between\nfarmers’ socioeconomic status and the practice of double- or\ntriple-cropping in An Giang Province in the MRD.Building\non the framework provided by these studies, we use systems-\nthinking to present an overarching picture of how anthro-\npogenic and natural-hazard drivers can interact to reinforce\nor diminish rice production.While many studies may have\nhighlighted the links between the various drivers and rice\nproduction, we seek to integrate the different drivers of an-\nthropogenic change and natural hazards to show their inter-\nrelated and interdependent nature and how the processes as-\nsociated with each driver affect rice growing areas, rice pro-\nduction and rice quality in general.The use of systems-thinking is appropriate as the wicked\nenvironmental problems present in the deltas of Vietnam\nare caused by a range of interdependent anthropogenic and\nnatural hazards drivers operating at multiple scales with no\neasily identiﬁable, predeﬁned solutions.While interventions\nmay be made to ameliorate problems, these interventions\nmay create feedbacks and unanticipated outcomes (Rittel\nand Webber, 1973; DeFries and Nagendra, 2017).In addi-\ntion, systems-thinking can be applied in a range of contexts\nand at multiple scales.Geist and Lambin (2002) and Lim et\nal.(2017) applied a system-dynamics approach to understand\ndrivers of deforestation and forest degradation at the national\nand global scales, while Ziegler et al.(2016) used a trans-\ndisciplinary learning approach to understand the role of en-\nvironmental and cultural factors in driving the development\nof human diseases in northeastern Thailand at the landscape\nscale.Our aim is to use a literature review to develop ﬂow dia-\ngrams to represent the major linkages between anthropogenic\nland-use factors and natural hazards and elaborate on how\nthey interact and inﬂuence rice productivity in these two\ndeltas.Due to the importance of Vietnam as a major rice pro-\nducer and exporter in Southeast Asia as well as the range of\nthreats faced by the rice sector from natural hazards and an-\nthropogenic land use, we hope to show how the processes\nand issues affecting food security are not one-dimensional\nand linear but in fact reinforcing and interdependent.Lastly,\ngiven that deltas worldwide are globally signiﬁcant for food\nproduction and are highly stressed and degraded landscapes,\nwe argue that a systems-thinking approach can be applied to\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'Additionally, a systems-\nthinking approach has allowed the multitude of drivers and\nenvironmental processes affecting rice production to be visu-\nalized and mapped in a manner that is easy to understand.As\nameliorating problems require policymakers and managers\nto have a good grasp of the different factors and processes\npresent, a method that considers all the different drivers and\npossible unintended consequences from the outset can avoid\noversimplifying a problem and assuming a straightforward\nsolution can be found (DeFries and Nagendra, 2017).For ex-\nample, to solve the problem of a shrinking delta, the effects of\n(high) dikes, sand mining, upstream dams and groundwater\nextraction have to be considered.While typhoons may pro-\nvide some ﬂuvial sediment to offset a shrinking delta (Darby\net al., 2016), the sediment load provided may not be sufﬁ-\ncient to offset sediment loss from sand mining and upstream\ndams.4.2 Adaptation and soft solutions\nRecognizing the environmental challenges limiting agricul-\ntural production, farmers in both deltas have adapted and im-\nprovised.Instead of accepting their fate, farmers overcome\nhigh soil salinities by implementing measures such as re-\nplacing rice with salinity-tolerant crops; transiting to shrimp\naquaculture; or turning to rice–shrimp farming, whereby rice\nis grown in the wet season, and shrimp is cultivated in the\ndry season.For those unable to switch from rice monocul-\nture, farmers have sought to grow rice on higher ground,\nshift crop calendars, or dig additional ditches to drain salt-\nwater and store fresh water.In addition, to prevent water\nstorage ponds from becoming contaminated with saltwater,\ncanvas sheets are placed on the soil surface to create a pro-\ntective barrier (Tran et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2012).Simi-\nlarly, farmers in peri-urban areas who are faced with shrink-\ning agricultural lands have turned to practicing agricultural\nintensiﬁcation and/or switched to planting high-value crops\nsuch as fruits and vegetables (Morton, 2020; van den Berg\net al., 2003).In short, farmers are constantly experimenting,\nlearning and sharing knowledge and experiences with other\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021']

"""What are the three seasons for rice crop production in the Mekong River Delta, and how much rice was produced in each season in 2018?"""	The three seasons for rice crop production in the Mekong River Delta are winter-spring, summer-autumn, and autumn-winter. In 2018, the planted area for spring (winter-spring) paddies was 1.6 million ha, for autumn (summer-autumn) paddies it was 2.3 million ha, and for winter (autumn-winter) paddies it was 197.2 thousand ha. The total rice produced over the three planting seasons was 24.5 million tonnes.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1475\nprovide a holistic and contextualized overview of the threats\nfaced in each location.2 Methods\n2.1 Study sites\nThe Mekong River Delta (MRD) is the world’s third-largest\ndelta, with a physical area of 4 million ha, and it is the\nlarger of the two deltas in Vietnam (Schneider and Asch,\n2020; Fig.1).In 2018, the planted area for spring, autumn\nand winter paddies was 1.6 million ha, 2.3 million ha and\n197.2 thousand ha, respectively.In total, 4.1 million ha of rice\nwas planted over the three planting seasons, with 24.5 million\ntonnes of rice produced.The delta is home to 17.8 million\npeople, with many dependent on agriculture for their liveli-\nhoods.That 54 % of Vietnam’s rice is grown in the MRD, and\nmost of it is exported overseas, makes it strategically impor-\ntant for the Vietnamese economy and for global food security\n(Chapman et al., 2016; Cosslett and Cosslett, 2018; General\nStatistics Ofﬁce of Vietnam, 2020).Up north, the Red River\nDelta (RRD) is the next largest, with a physical delta area of\n1.5 million ha (Fig.1; Schneider and Asch, 2020).In 2018,\n1 million ha of planted rice produced 6.3 million tonnes of\nrice, the equivalent of 14 % of Vietnam’s total rice produc-\ntion (524.3 and 516.4 thousand ha of rice was planted in\nthe spring and winter seasons, respectively).Approximately\n21.6 million people live in the RRD, with many also de-\npendent on agriculture (General Statistics Ofﬁce of Vietnam,\n2020).Soils in the MRD are highly variable, with alluvial, acid\nsulfate and saline soils dominant.Most of the rice grows\nin the highly fertile alluvial soils, which are found in only\n30 % of the delta (GRSP, 2013).Conversely, soils in the RRD\nconsist of Holocene delta sediments.These Holocene delta\nsediments are relatively ﬁne-grained muds and sands, up to\n30 m thick, that are the product of rapid progradation during\nthe Holocene high sea level stand (Mathers and Zalasiewicz,\n1999).The Holocene sequence overlies coarse-grained Pleis-\ntocene sediments dominated by braided river and alluvial fan\ndeposits formed during the last glacial low sea level stand.The Quaternary sediments are underlain by a >400 m thick\nlayer of Neogene sedimentary rocks that are made up of con-\nglomerate sandstone, clay and siltstone (Berg et al., 2007).Climatically, the MRD has a tropical monsoon climate\nwith two distinct seasons, a dry season from December to\nApril and a rainy season from May to November.It is gen-\nerally warm year round, with average temperatures in 2018\nranging from 26◦C in December, January and February to\n29◦C in May.The annual rainfall is between 2000 and\n2400 mm (General Statistics Ofﬁce, 2018; Kotera et al.,\n2008).Conversely, the RRD has a tropical monsoon climate\nwith three seasons: (1) a hot and wet season from May to\nSeptember, (2) a cool and dry season from October to Jan-uary, and (3) a cool and humid season from February to\nApril.The hot and wet season is characterized by high tem-\nperatures and high rainfall, the cool and dry season has mod-\nerate to low temperatures and low rainfall, and the cool and\nhumid season has low to moderate temperatures and low\nrainfall (Huong et al., 2013; Li et al., 2006).In 2018, the\nmonthly average temperatures in the RRD ranged from 17◦C\nin February to 30◦C in June.Average annual rainfall is be-\ntween 1300 and 1800 mm (Li et al., 2006; General Statis-\ntics Ofﬁce, 2018).Both deltas are low-lying, with elevations\nranging from 0.7 to 1.2 m a.s.l.(above sea level) (Binh et al.,\n2017).', 'K.

The ref-\nerences we used are found in the Supplement.\n3 Results\n3.1 Local anthropogenic drivers\n3.1.1 Aquaculture and alternative crops\nBoth deltas face widespread salinity intrusion that threatens\nrice production. In the Mekong River Delta, salinity intrusion\nis a naturally occurring phenomenon during the dry season.\nTides from the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand\nbring saltwater inland, and salinity intrudes up to 70–90 km\ninland as the length of sea dikes is limited. There are 1500 km\nof sea and estuary dikes in RRD versus 450 km of sea dikes\nin the MRD (Le et al., 2018; Preston et al., 2003; Pilarcyzk\nand Nguyen, 2005). Thus, salinity intrusion extends up to20 km from the main river in the RRD (Ca et al., 1994). As\nrice plants are unable to thrive in soils with soil salinities ex-\nceeding 4 g L−1(V . H. T. Pham et al., 2018), affected farmers\nhave converted their paddy ﬁelds into aquaculture ponds to\ncultivate shrimp and ﬁsh instead. Other farmers have turned\nto planting salinity-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango\nand sugarcane. In some cases, farmers have opted for a rice-\naquaculture system, whereby rice is planted in the wet sea-\nson, and ﬁsh and shrimp are cultivated in the dry season,\nwhen soil salinities are high (Nguyen and V o, 2017; Pham\net al., 2017).\nBesides environmental factors, the greater proﬁtability of\nfruits, vegetables, ﬁsh and shrimp also incentivizes farmers\nto plant more non-rice crops. The income per hectare of\nrice was USD 146 compared to pomelo (USD 16 844) and\ncoconut (USD 1484) (Hoang and Tran, 2019). Meanwhile,\nfarmers who practice shrimp–rice rotational systems earned\n50 % more than those who had two rice crops (Morton, 2020;\nSchneider and Asch, 2020). In addition, high demand for\nfruits and vegetables for export and from growing urban pop-\nulations with greater afﬂuence and knowledge about nutrition\nalso encouraged farmers to diversify from rice monoculture,\nleading to possible declines in the overall rice growing area\n(Hai, 2021; Nguyen and V o, 2017; Fig. 4).\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.

"""How does the increase or decrease in anthropogenic drivers influence rice productivity in the Mekong Delta, according to the report?"""	Anthropogenic drivers can significantly influence rice productivity in the Mekong Delta. For instance, local drivers such as the construction of dikes can reduce flooding, which can facilitate triple-cropping of rice and increase yields. However, if these dikes are poorly maintained or planned, they can increase flooding. Moreover, high dikes can reduce the availability of fertile silt, forcing farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. The use of agrochemicals can reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but overuse can lead to pesticide resistance, potentially increasing outbreaks of pests and diseases. Government policies encouraging farmers to shift from rice to non-rice crops have also led to increased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards, and aquaculture. Urban expansion is another key factor reducing rice growing areas. For example, in Hanoi, a significant amount of agricultural land is being converted to urban land, leading to a decline in rice growing areas. High land prices and shrinking availability of arable land have forced farmers to intensify their agricultural practices. Despite these challenges, rice production in the Red River Delta grew by more than 25% from 2000 to 2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas. Regional drivers, those occurring farther away from the two mega-deltas but within the Asian region, also play a role, but the specific impacts on rice productivity in the Mekong Delta are not clearly outlined in the context.	['1478 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 4. Flow diagram showing the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. The drivers\nare classiﬁed as a local driver if it occurs in the two mega-deltas. Regional drivers are those that occur farther away from the two mega-deltas\nbut within the Asian region. A plus ( +) sign indicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to increase (decrease). A negative ( −) sign\nindicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to decrease (increase). Dashed lines with “ ±” are used when outcomes are unclear. For\nexample, dikes reduce ﬂooding, but poorly maintained or planned dikes increase ﬂooding instead. In addition, dikes may potentially cause\nﬂooding in unprotected areas. Agrochemical use may reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but the overuse of chemicals can lead to\npesticide resistance, which may increase outbreaks of pests and diseases.\nFinally, government policies encouraging farmers to move\naway from growing rice also contributed to the planting of\nmore non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is\nincreased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards,\nand freshwater and brackish aquaculture (Van Kien et al.,\n2020). Using remote sensing to assess land-use and land-\ncover change in the Mekong River Delta, Liu et al. (2020)\nfound that aquaculture had become the second-largest land-\nuse type, following planted land. This was facilitated by gov-\nernment regulations, salt intrusion and higher proﬁtability\nof aquaculture productions. In any case, even though farm-\ners may have moved on from growing rice, many still con-\ntinue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops\n(Normile, 2013; Fig. 4).\n3.1.2 Urban expansion\nRapid urbanization is accelerating the loss of agricultural\nland in both the Red River Delta and Mekong River Delta. In\nHanoi, a major city in the Red River Delta, 1420 ha of agri-cultural land was lost per year from 2000–2007, equivalent to\na yearly loss of 3 %. By 2025, up to 450 000 ha of agricultural\nland is expected to be converted to urban land. Most of this\nland-use conversion occurs in peri-urban areas 5–15 km from\nthe city center. The same peri-urban land is often used to\ngrow food, ﬂowers and livestock for the urban population in\nHanoi. However, this land is considered by local authorities\nto be land reserve for urban planning instead of resources for\nfood supply (Drebold, 2017; Pham et al., 2015). Most of this\nperi-urban agricultural land is often forcibly obtained, with\nminimal compensation given to farmers, and then sold to for-\neign developers (Drebold, 2017). Similar urban expansion is\nalso occurring in Can Tho city in the Mekong River Delta,\nwith corresponding losses of agricultural land (cf. Garscha-\ngen et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2010). A decline in agricultural\nland means a decline in rice growing areas as well (Fig. 4).\nHigh land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land\nhave forced farmers to practice agricultural intensiﬁcation. In\nthe RRD, rice production grew more than 25 % from 2000–\n2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', '1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M.

What are some of the changes farmers in the Mekong River Delta have made to their farming practices due to the widespread salinity intrusion that threatens rice production?	Farmers in the Mekong River Delta have made several changes to their farming practices due to widespread salinity intrusion. Some have shifted away from rice monoculture to embrace non-rice crops. This shift has been incentivized by higher prices and rising demand for aquaculture and non-rice products. Environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have also forced many farmers to convert their now-unusable rice fields into shrimp ponds. Additionally, some farmers have turned to growing salt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango, and sugar cane.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '1474 K.

T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M.

Based on the context, how has the shift from rice farming to aquaculture, driven by factors such as government regulations and salt intrusion, impacted the use of paddy land in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	The shift from rice farming to aquaculture in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, driven by factors such as government regulations and salt intrusion, has led to an increased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards, and both freshwater and brackish aquaculture. This shift was also facilitated by the higher profitability of aquaculture productions. As a result, aquaculture has become the second-largest land-use type in the region, following planted land. Despite this shift, many farmers who have moved on from growing rice still continue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops.	['1478 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 4. Flow diagram showing the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. The drivers\nare classiﬁed as a local driver if it occurs in the two mega-deltas. Regional drivers are those that occur farther away from the two mega-deltas\nbut within the Asian region. A plus ( +) sign indicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to increase (decrease). A negative ( −) sign\nindicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to decrease (increase). Dashed lines with “ ±” are used when outcomes are unclear. For\nexample, dikes reduce ﬂooding, but poorly maintained or planned dikes increase ﬂooding instead. In addition, dikes may potentially cause\nﬂooding in unprotected areas. Agrochemical use may reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but the overuse of chemicals can lead to\npesticide resistance, which may increase outbreaks of pests and diseases.\nFinally, government policies encouraging farmers to move\naway from growing rice also contributed to the planting of\nmore non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is\nincreased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards,\nand freshwater and brackish aquaculture (Van Kien et al.,\n2020). Using remote sensing to assess land-use and land-\ncover change in the Mekong River Delta, Liu et al. (2020)\nfound that aquaculture had become the second-largest land-\nuse type, following planted land. This was facilitated by gov-\nernment regulations, salt intrusion and higher proﬁtability\nof aquaculture productions. In any case, even though farm-\ners may have moved on from growing rice, many still con-\ntinue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops\n(Normile, 2013; Fig. 4).\n3.1.2 Urban expansion\nRapid urbanization is accelerating the loss of agricultural\nland in both the Red River Delta and Mekong River Delta. In\nHanoi, a major city in the Red River Delta, 1420 ha of agri-cultural land was lost per year from 2000–2007, equivalent to\na yearly loss of 3 %. By 2025, up to 450 000 ha of agricultural\nland is expected to be converted to urban land. Most of this\nland-use conversion occurs in peri-urban areas 5–15 km from\nthe city center. The same peri-urban land is often used to\ngrow food, ﬂowers and livestock for the urban population in\nHanoi. However, this land is considered by local authorities\nto be land reserve for urban planning instead of resources for\nfood supply (Drebold, 2017; Pham et al., 2015). Most of this\nperi-urban agricultural land is often forcibly obtained, with\nminimal compensation given to farmers, and then sold to for-\neign developers (Drebold, 2017). Similar urban expansion is\nalso occurring in Can Tho city in the Mekong River Delta,\nwith corresponding losses of agricultural land (cf. Garscha-\ngen et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2010). A decline in agricultural\nland means a decline in rice growing areas as well (Fig. 4).\nHigh land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land\nhave forced farmers to practice agricultural intensiﬁcation. In\nthe RRD, rice production grew more than 25 % from 2000–\n2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

What are the potential impacts of intensified cropping practices and the overuse of pesticides on the natural ecosystem and rice quality in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Intensified cropping practices and the overuse of pesticides can have several impacts on the natural ecosystem and rice quality in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. High seeding densities and the use of susceptible varieties in intensive rice production can lead to an increase in pests such as the brown planthopper. The overuse of nitrogen fertilizers can also enhance the pests' reproductive potential. Furthermore, excessive use of pesticides can kill natural predators of rice pests, such as spiders, ants, bees, beetles, dragonflies, frogs, ladybugs, and wasps. This can lead to an imbalance in the ecosystem as these predators help control pest populations. Pests targeted by the pesticides may also develop resistance, requiring higher doses of the pesticide for effective control in the future. In terms of rice quality, a study in Nam Dinh Province in the Red River Delta found high concentrations of pesticide residues in agricultural soils. Frequently detected pesticides include isoprothiolane, chlorpyrifos, and propiconazole. These residues not only pollute the environment but also lower the quality of rice sold for consumption.

"""How does the annual deposition of sediment-bound nutrients from floodwaters potentially benefit farmers by supplying over half of the fertilizers needed for a season of rice crop in the Mekong Delta?"""	"The annual deposition of sediment-bound nutrients from floodwaters can be a significant benefit to farmers, particularly those who are less economically endowed. This is because these nutrients can naturally supply over half of the fertilizers needed for a season of rice crop. This provision of ""free"" fertilizers by the encroaching floodwaters reduces the need for farmers to purchase artificial fertilizers to maintain their yields."	['Some\ndeposition was found only if there had been a dike breach\nwhich also caused crop damage (Chapman et al., 2016).The\nvalue of ﬂood deposits is reiterated by the study of Manh\net al.(2015), which estimated that the annual deposition of\nsediment-bound nutrients can naturally supply over half of\nthe fertilizers needed for a season of rice crop.The provision\nof “free” fertilizers by the encroaching ﬂoodwaters beneﬁts\nthe less economically endowed farmers who must purchase\nartiﬁcial fertilizers to maintain yields (Chapman et al., 2017;\nKondolf et al., 2018; Fig.4).However, poorly planned and/or maintained dikes are not\nonly functionally ineffective against ﬂoodwaters or coastal\nsurges; they may also become an ampliﬁer of destruction\nwhen their presence creates a false sense of security which\nresults in intensive development of low-lying areas (Mai et\nal., 2009; Tran et al., 2018).In addition, areas unprotected\nby dikes may be more vulnerable to ﬂooding as the excess\nwater has to ﬂow somewhere.Using a GIS-linked numeri-\ncal model, Le et al.(2007) conﬁrmed that engineering struc-\ntures in the MRD increased water levels and ﬂow velocities\nin rivers and canals.This in turn increased the risk of ﬂood-\ning in both non-protected areas and protected areas (due to\ndike failure).Dashed lines are used in Fig.4 to show that\ndikes do not necessarily reduce ﬂooding.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'K.

V .Pham et al., 2018; Winkel et al., 2011), there is no re-\nsearch on (groundwater induced) land subsidence in the Red\nRiver Delta.Thus, the magnitude of land subsidence in the\ndelta is uncertain and should be an area for future research.3.2 Regional anthropogenic drivers\n3.2.1 Upstream dams\nThe Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau and\nﬂows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo-\ndia and southern Vietnam.To meet growing demands for\nelectricity, many small- and large-scale hydropower projects\nhave been commissioned in each country to take advantage\nof this supposedly green and clean source of energy (Nhan\nand Cao, 2019; Manh et al., 2015).A total of 241 dams\nhave been completed in the entire Mekong basin, with an-\nother 29 under construction.A further 91 are currently be-\ning planned.These 361 dams consist of 176 hydropower\ndams and 185 irrigation dams.Of the 364 dams in the\nMekong, 20 are in Vietnamese territory (WLE Mekong\nCGIAR, 2020a).Conversely, the Red River originates in\nYunnan Province in China and ﬂows towards northern Viet-\nnam.It is less heavily dammed, with a total of 105 dams in\nChina and Vietnam.There are 25 hydropower dams, 3 multi-\npurpose dams and 9 irrigation dams in the Red River basin in\nVietnam (Vinh et al., 2014; WLE Mekong CGIAR, 2020b).While there are no dams in the Mekong River Delta or the\nRed River Delta due to their relatively ﬂat elevation, up-\nstream dam development inﬂuences downstream regions in\nmany ways, with the environmental impacts extending far\nbeyond the dam itself (Kondolf et al., 2014).Firstly, a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel and\nsuspended sediment is impounded in reservoirs behind the\ndams instead of being transported downstream.This dimin-\nished sediment load may aggravate erosion downstream from\nthe dam (Nhan and Cao, 2019; Fig.4).Using a network\nmodel, under a “deﬁnitive future” scenario of 38 new dams,\nthe cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River\nDelta would be 51 %.Conversely, under full build-up of\n133 new dams, only 4 % of the pre-dam sediment load will\nreach the delta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Manh et al.(2015)\nalso reached similar conclusions with a quasi-2D hydrody-\nnamic model of suspended sediment dynamics.Floodplainsedimentation would decrease by about 21 % to 96 %, while\nsediment load supplied to the sea at the river will diminish by\n1 % to 95 %, with the extreme values representing full dam\nbuild-up.Even if dam construction was limited to the river\ntributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment\ntrapped could be as high as 68 %, meaning that only about\n32 % of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River\nDelta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Indeed, Binh et al.(2020) found that the suspended sed-\niment loads in the MRD had decreased by 74.1 % in 2012–\n2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang\ncascade in China.']
What are the measures taken to prevent salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta and how does sand mining affect the frequency of flooding and soil fertility in the region?	In the Mekong River Delta (MRD), measures taken to prevent salinity intrusion include the construction of sea dikes and salinization prevention dikes. There are 1290 km of salinization prevention dikes and 450 km of sea dikes in the MRD. Sand mining in the MRD has significant effects on the frequency of flooding and soil fertility. Large-scale sand mining operations have created numerous pits and pools, which trap sediments and prevent them from traveling downstream. This disrupts natural flooding and has led to a decrease in flood frequency by 7.8% from 2005–2015. The reduction in flood frequency results in decreased volumes of water and sediments for agricultural production. Floodwaters typically deposit fertile sediments and flush out pesticides and fertilizers from intensive agricultural production. When flood frequency decreases, the frequency at which farmlands benefit from this natural soil quality enhancement also decreases. This could lead to a decrease in soil fertility over time and result in declines in rice yields unless artificial fertilizers are added.	['1480 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nLikewise, the RRD is also heavily diked, with 3000 km of\nriver dikes (Fig.5), but unlike the MRD, high dikes are ab-\nsent (Pilarcyzk and Nguyen, 2005).Besides river and ﬂood\ncontrol dikes, there are also sea dikes and salinization pre-\nvention dikes in both deltas to protect the area from salinity\nintrusion.There are 1500 km of sea and estuary dikes in the\nRRD.In the MRD, there are 1290 km of salinization preven-\ntion dikes and 450 km of sea dikes (Le et al., 2018; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005; Fig.4).3.1.4 Sand mining\nSand mining is carried out on a large scale in the Mekong\n(Kondolf et al., 2018).Fueled by demand from reclamation,\nexport and construction, 55.2 million tonnes of sediment\nwas extracted from the Mekong main stem in Laos, Thai-\nland, Cambodia and Vietnam from 2011 to 2012 (Bravard\nand Gaillot, 2013; Robert, 2017).A more recent analysis of\nbathymetric maps and the local reﬁlling processes by Jor-\ndan et al.(2019) put the amount of sand extracted from the\nMekong River Delta in 2018 at 17.77 Mm3.Besides removing large quantities of riverbed sediments,\nsand mining operations have created numerous pits and\npools.These pits and pools, which can be up to 45 m deep,\nthen become sediment traps, trapping bed loads from up-\nstream reaches and preventing them from traveling down-\nstream and contributing to the continued presence and\ngrowth of the delta.In addition, bed incision also occurs\nas the water is sediment-starved.The down-cutting of river-\nbanks can propagate upstream and downstream from the ex-\ntraction sites for many kilometers, in turn affecting river\necosystems over a large area (Kondolf et al., 2018).This bank\nincision results in land loss, which threatens rice growing ar-\neas (Fig.4).Aggressive sand mining also disrupts natural ﬂooding.A\nrecent study of the effects of riverine mining on ﬂood fre-\nquency in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle (LXQ) in the Mekong\nRiver Delta found that ﬂood frequency had dropped by 7.8 %\nfrom 2005–2015.Water levels at local gauge stations also\nshowed an overall decreasing trend, indicating that the low-\nering of the riverbed had reduced the frequency of ﬂooding.Disrupted ﬂood regimes result in reduced volumes of water\nand sediments for agricultural production.In addition, ﬂood-\nwaters typically deposit fertile sediments while ﬂushing the\npesticides and fertilizers accumulated from intensive agricul-\ntural production.When the ﬂood frequency decreases, the\nfrequency at which farmlands beneﬁt from this natural soil\nquality enhancement decreases.Consequently, soil fertility\nmay decrease over time and lead to declines in rice yields un-\nless artiﬁcial fertilizers are added (Park et al., 2020; Fig.4).While there are several studies on the diffuse, yet insidious\nnature of sand mining in the Mekong (cf.Bravard and Gail-\nlot, 2013; Brunier et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2019; Kondolf\net al., 2018; Park et al., 2020; Robert, 2017; Schmitt et al.,\n2017), the extent of sand mining in the Red River Delta isunclear as there is almost no research on this issue.We did\nhowever come across an article in a Vietnamese newspaper\nabout rampant sand mining in the Red River and how min-\ning operations have caused erosion in nearby villages (Chinh,\n2018).Similar to the situation in the MRD, the authorities\nhave turned a blind eye to this illegal business (Bravard and\nGaillot, 2013; Chinh, 2018).3.1.5 Groundwater extraction\nAnother example of an anthropogenic development creating\nother interrelated problems is that of groundwater extraction.', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

"""How has the increased groundwater extraction affected the severity of saltwater intrusion and the suitability of land for rice cultivation in the Mekong River Delta?"""	The increased groundwater extraction in the Mekong River Delta has exacerbated land subsidence, which in turn has amplified the severity and extent of saltwater intrusion. This has led to a reduction in the suitability of land for rice cultivation. The subsidence rates from groundwater extraction were found to be between 1.1 and 2.5 cm per year. Over 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991, this has resulted in an average of 18 cm of subsidence, with some areas experiencing over 30 cm of subsidence. This land subsidence, caused by excessive groundwater extraction, increases the vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and reduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.	['While groundwater extraction has increased the availability\nof water for human activities, it has exacerbated land subsi-\ndence, which has increased the severity and extent of salt-\nwater intrusion and reduced the suitability of land for rice\ncultivation (Fig.4).Minderhoud et al.(2017) developed a\n3D numerical groundwater ﬂow model of the MRD surface\nand found that subsidence rates from groundwater extraction\nwere between 1.1 and 2.5 cm yr−1.The model also showed\nthat 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 had re-\nsulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence, with\nsome hotspots recording over 30 cm of subsidence.Land sub-\nsidence from excessive groundwater extraction acts as a cat-\nalyst that increases vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and\nreduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.Moreover, rice crops become contaminated with arsenic\nwhen arsenic-rich groundwater used for non-agricultural use\nis discharged into rivers, and the river water is used for rice ir-\nrigation (Lan and Giao, 2017; Minderhoud et al., 2018).High\narsenic concentrations in groundwater seem to be of natu-\nral origin.In the Mekong River Delta, naturally occurring\nbiochemical and hydrological processes cause As to be re-\nleased from Fe oxides in rocks and sediments into groundwa-\nter reservoirs (Fendorf et al., 2010).In addition, deep ground-\nwater extraction causes interbedded clays to compact and ex-\npel water containing dissolved As (Erban et al., 2013).Crop\nquality is reduced when the arsenic-enriched water is de-\nposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth\n(Rahman and Hasegawa, 2011; Fig.4).Similarly, prevalence of groundwater extraction is also\nhigh in the Red River Delta.Approximately 70 % of the\npopulation living in the RRD accesses water from Holocene\nand Pleistocene aquifers (Berg et al., 2007; Winkel et al.,\n2011).Groundwater in the Red River Delta is also contam-\ninated with high levels of As due to reductive dissolution\nof As from iron oxyhydroxides in buried sediment (Berg et\nal., 2007; Luu, 2019).Berg et al.(2007) sampled 196 tube\nwells randomly over a 700 km2area in the Red River Delta,\nand the concentrations of As in groundwater ranged from\n1 to 3050 µg L−1, with an average of 159 µg L−1.Separately,\nWinkel et al.(2011) collected 512 water samples from pri-\nvate wells in the Red River ﬂoodplain and found As concen-\ntrations varying from <0.1 to 810 µg L−1, with 27 % of the\nsamples exceeding the WHO guideline value of 10 µg L−1.Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K.

How has the construction of dams in the Mekong River basin affected the sediment load reaching the Mekong Delta and what could be the potential impact on the region's agriculture?	The construction of dams in the Mekong River basin has significantly reduced the sediment load reaching the Mekong Delta. For instance, under a scenario of 38 new dams, the cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River Delta would be 51%. If 133 new dams were built, only 4% of the pre-dam sediment load would reach the delta. This diminished sediment load may exacerbate erosion downstream from the dam. The reduction in sediment loads can also impact the size of the delta and rice growing areas. Changes in water levels due to dams can create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if planting calendars remain unchanged. Lowered water levels during dry seasons due to upstream water impoundment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion, creating unfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.	['In particular, the Manwan and Dachaoshan\ndams contributed to 32 % of the reduction.In addition,\nfrom 2014–2017, the average incision rate of the Tien River\nin the MRD was 3 times higher than the previously recorded\nvalue.Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of\n14.8 % of the annual riverbed incision, while the remainder\nwas caused by hydropower dams upstream.The deleterious impacts of dams on sediment loads can\nalso be found in the Red River Delta in spite of the smaller\nnumber of dams.While the Hoa Binh dam is located on a\ntributary of the Red River in Vietnam, its large size has in-\nﬂuenced suspended sediment distribution in the lower Red\nRiver basin.For example, an analysis of the suspended sedi-\nment concentration over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010\nshowed that yearly suspended sediment ﬂux had dropped by\n61 % at Son Tay near Hanoi (Vinh et al., 2014).Similarly,\nDuc et al.(2012) calculated that the suspended sediment bud-\nget at Son Tay and Hanoi hydrological monitoring stations\nwas reduced by 56 % after the Hoa Binh dam became oper-\national in 1989.The reduction in sediment loads at the Red\nRiver Delta would likewise have a similar impact on delta\nsize and rice growing areas.Besides a change in sediment loads, dams also alter stream\ndischarge and water levels, with concurrent effects on wa-\nter supplies (not shown in Fig.4).When water levels are\nhigh during the rainy season, dams can be used to impound\nthe excess water in the reservoir behind.During the dry sea-\nson, when water levels are lower, the dams can release wa-\nter downstream.In doing so, dams increase dry-season dis-\ncharge and decrease wet-season discharge.The modiﬁcation\nof seasonal water ﬂows is problematic as changes in natu-\nral ﬂow patterns, such as higher ﬂows in the dry season and\nlower ﬂows in the wet season, would affect rice production\nas rice growing calendars are currently linked to the natu-\nral ﬂuctuations in high and low ﬂows (Robert, 2017).Hence,\nchanges in water levels due to anthropogenic interventions\nmay create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if plant-\ning calendars remain unchanged.In addition, lowered water\nlevels during dry seasons due to upstream water impound-\nment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion and create\nunfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'K.

"""How have the changes in water levels due to dams and other human interventions potentially increased saltwater intrusion and created unfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers in the Mekong Delta?"""	Human interventions such as the construction of dams and sand mining have significantly altered the water levels in the Mekong Delta. Dams trap sediments in reservoirs upstream, reducing sediment accumulation downstream. This impacts the natural process of delta growth and maintenance. Sand mining, on the other hand, removes large quantities of riverbed sediments and creates pits and pools that trap sediments, preventing them from traveling downstream. This not only disrupts the natural flooding process but also leads to bed incision, causing land loss which threatens rice growing areas. Moreover, these activities have led to a decrease in the frequency of natural freshwater flooding. Floodwaters typically deposit fertile sediments and flush out accumulated pesticides and fertilizers, enhancing soil quality. A decrease in flood frequency reduces this natural soil quality enhancement, potentially leading to a decline in soil fertility and rice yields unless artificial fertilizers are added. Furthermore, these changes in water levels can exacerbate the problem of saltwater intrusion. For instance, the reduction in freshwater flooding can worsen the extent of salinity intrusion due to a lack of fresh water. This, along with the process of land subsidence from groundwater extraction and rising sea levels, can potentially reduce rice growing areas in the future. In addition, climate change may also exacerbate these effects by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters, which could intensify problems such as saltwater flooding and saltwater intrusion. Therefore, these human interventions and natural hazards have created unfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers in the Mekong Delta.	['K. W.

Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nLikewise, the RRD is also heavily diked, with 3000 km of\nriver dikes (Fig.5), but unlike the MRD, high dikes are ab-\nsent (Pilarcyzk and Nguyen, 2005).Besides river and ﬂood\ncontrol dikes, there are also sea dikes and salinization pre-\nvention dikes in both deltas to protect the area from salinity\nintrusion.There are 1500 km of sea and estuary dikes in the\nRRD.In the MRD, there are 1290 km of salinization preven-\ntion dikes and 450 km of sea dikes (Le et al., 2018; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005; Fig.4).3.1.4 Sand mining\nSand mining is carried out on a large scale in the Mekong\n(Kondolf et al., 2018).Fueled by demand from reclamation,\nexport and construction, 55.2 million tonnes of sediment\nwas extracted from the Mekong main stem in Laos, Thai-\nland, Cambodia and Vietnam from 2011 to 2012 (Bravard\nand Gaillot, 2013; Robert, 2017).A more recent analysis of\nbathymetric maps and the local reﬁlling processes by Jor-\ndan et al.(2019) put the amount of sand extracted from the\nMekong River Delta in 2018 at 17.77 Mm3.Besides removing large quantities of riverbed sediments,\nsand mining operations have created numerous pits and\npools.These pits and pools, which can be up to 45 m deep,\nthen become sediment traps, trapping bed loads from up-\nstream reaches and preventing them from traveling down-\nstream and contributing to the continued presence and\ngrowth of the delta.In addition, bed incision also occurs\nas the water is sediment-starved.The down-cutting of river-\nbanks can propagate upstream and downstream from the ex-\ntraction sites for many kilometers, in turn affecting river\necosystems over a large area (Kondolf et al., 2018).This bank\nincision results in land loss, which threatens rice growing ar-\neas (Fig.4).Aggressive sand mining also disrupts natural ﬂooding.A\nrecent study of the effects of riverine mining on ﬂood fre-\nquency in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle (LXQ) in the Mekong\nRiver Delta found that ﬂood frequency had dropped by 7.8 %\nfrom 2005–2015.Water levels at local gauge stations also\nshowed an overall decreasing trend, indicating that the low-\nering of the riverbed had reduced the frequency of ﬂooding.Disrupted ﬂood regimes result in reduced volumes of water\nand sediments for agricultural production.In addition, ﬂood-\nwaters typically deposit fertile sediments while ﬂushing the\npesticides and fertilizers accumulated from intensive agricul-\ntural production.When the ﬂood frequency decreases, the\nfrequency at which farmlands beneﬁt from this natural soil\nquality enhancement decreases.Consequently, soil fertility\nmay decrease over time and lead to declines in rice yields un-\nless artiﬁcial fertilizers are added (Park et al., 2020; Fig.4).While there are several studies on the diffuse, yet insidious\nnature of sand mining in the Mekong (cf.Bravard and Gail-\nlot, 2013; Brunier et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2019; Kondolf\net al., 2018; Park et al., 2020; Robert, 2017; Schmitt et al.,\n2017), the extent of sand mining in the Red River Delta isunclear as there is almost no research on this issue.We did\nhowever come across an article in a Vietnamese newspaper\nabout rampant sand mining in the Red River and how min-\ning operations have caused erosion in nearby villages (Chinh,\n2018).Similar to the situation in the MRD, the authorities\nhave turned a blind eye to this illegal business (Bravard and\nGaillot, 2013; Chinh, 2018).3.1.5 Groundwater extraction\nAnother example of an anthropogenic development creating\nother interrelated problems is that of groundwater extraction.']

How does saltwater flooding during a typhoon affect rice production in the Mekong Delta, considering that rice is not adapted to withstand prolonged submergence and/or saline conditions?	Saltwater flooding during a typhoon can adversely affect rice production in the Mekong Delta. Since rice is not adapted to withstand prolonged submergence and saline conditions, such flooding can reduce the rice growing areas. The strong winds, heavy precipitation, and storm surges associated with a typhoon can lead to widespread flooding, including saltwater flooding, which can further exacerbate the situation.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1483\nIn terms of growth stage, rice plants at the tillering stage are\nmore likely to succumb to submergence than those at the veg-\netative stage.Plants fully submerged for short durations (2 d)\nalso had lower chances of survival than those that were par-\ntially submerged in ﬂoodwaters for longer durations (up to\n8 d).As such the effect of ﬂooding on rice growing areas is\nvariable as other factors that affect crop mortality include the\ntype of rice grown, the stage of rice growth, and the depth\nand length of submergence in ﬂoodwaters (Fig.6).Although severe ﬂooding can disrupt agricultural activi-\nties, moderate levels of freshwater ﬂooding bring beneﬁts\nto (rural) farmers (EEPSEA, 2011).Floodwaters from rivers\nimprove agricultural productivity by depositing nutrient-rich\nﬂood sediments on agricultural soils (Chapman et al., 2016).In addition, ﬂoods wash away contaminants, purify and\nrecharge aquifers, kill pests, and mitigate saltwater intrusion\n(EEPSEA, 2011; Hoang et al., 2018; Fig.6).Aquatic re-\nsources such as ﬁsh, crabs and snails also come in with the\nﬂoodwaters, which local farmers can collect to supplement\ntheir incomes.Besides growing rice, it is also possible to cul-\ntivate vegetables, ﬁsh, prawns and ducks in the ﬂooded ﬁelds\n(Nguyen and James, 2013).Towards the end of the ﬂooding\nseason and the start of the rice cultivation season, ﬂoodwa-\nters provide the water needed to start growing rice (Hoa et\nal., 2008).While there are investments in ﬂood prevention measures\nwith the construction and upgrading of river dikes, the con-\nstruction and dredging of reservoirs and drainage canals, and\nthe raising of roads and embankments, recent ﬂoods have\ncaused substantial agricultural losses as current measures\nhave proven to be inadequate (Hoa et al., 2008; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005).In 2018, 39 000 ha of rice in the RRD\nwas inundated by heavy rains and ﬂoods triggered by Ty-\nphoon Son-Tinh (VNA, 2018a).Similarly, due to a lack of\nembankments and/or poor construction and maintenance of\nexisting embankments, more than 2000 ha of rice was lost\nduring the annual ﬂoods in 2018.An Giang Province was the\nworst-affected, losing 1270 ha of rice (VNA, 2018b).3.3.3 Typhoons\nTyphoons are the most severe natural hazard that affects Viet-\nnam.When a typhoon occurs, affected areas are exposed to\nstrong winds of up to 50 m/s and up to 300 mm of rainfall\nin a day.As the rainy season in Vietnam coincides with the\ntyphoon season, widespread ﬂooding can be expected from\nheavy rain and overﬂowing rivers (CCFSC, 2005; Mai et\nal., 2009; K.-A.Nguyen et al., 2019).Storm surges can also\noccur when high winds pushing on the ocean’s surface are\ncombined with the effect of low pressure in the center of\na typhoon (Takagi et al., 2013).A study of typhoon disas-\nters in Vietnam since 1950 showed that half of the 450 ty-\nphoons recorded during the study period were accompanied\nby a storm surge of over 1 m, and 11 % were over 2.5 m high\n(Imamura and Van To, 1997).In the Red River Delta, Quynhet al.(1998) found that the maximum storm surge is usually\nbetween 1 to 1.5 m a.m.s.l.(above mean sea level).In short,\nrice production will be adversely affected by strong winds\nand widespread ﬂooding from heavy precipitation and storm\nsurges in the event of a typhoon.Saltwater ﬂooding may re-\nduce rice growing areas as rice is not adapted to withstand\nprolonged submergence and/or saline conditions.', '1482 K.

Flow diagram showing the natural hazards that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. Local drivers refer to\nnatural hazards that occur within the two mega-deltas. Although sea level rise has implications on a local scale, it is considered a global\ndriver as it occurs on a global scale. The effect of ﬂooding on rice growing areas is variable as other factors that affect crop mortality include\nthe type of rice grown, the stage of rice growth, and the depth and length of submergence in ﬂoodwaters.\n3.3 Local natural-hazard drivers\n3.3.1 Drought\nDroughts do not result solely from a lack of rainfall; they\ncan also result from changes in the arrival of rains and the\nlength of the wet season (Adamson and Bird, 2010; Lassa et\nal., 2016). Vietnam was affected by droughts in 1997–1998,\n2002–2003, 2009–2010 and most recently in 2015–2016.\nThe 2015–2016 drought was the most severe in 90 years\n(Grosjean et al., 2016). All 13 provinces in the Mekong River\nDelta were affected by the 2015 drought. Besides a lack of\nwater for irrigation, the drought caused saltwater to intrude\nup to 70 km inland. Cumulatively, the drought and accompa-\nnying saltwater intrusion damaged 400 000 ha of rice crops,\nincluding 50 000 ha of paddy in Kien Giang and Ca Mau\nprovinces in the MRD (Grosjean et al., 2016; Nguyen, 2017).\nAlthough there is no research on how droughts and salinity\nintrusion have affected rice quality in Vietnam, research from\nelsewhere has shown that water shortages and salt stress in-\nduce physiochemical alterations which affect the rice grains\nproduced (Pandey et al., 2014; Razzaq et al., 2019; Fig. 6).\nCompared to the MRD, research and reports on droughts\nin the Red River Delta are scarce. The UNW-DPC (2014)reported that the RRD experienced droughts from the end\nof 1998 to April 1999, which affected 86 140 ha of rice. An-\nother drought occurred from January to February 2004, with\nthe water level of the Red River at the lowest in 40 years. Low\nwater levels were also reported in 2010; however drought\nconditions and saltwater intrusion were more severe in the\nMRD (Overland, 2010). The effect of droughts on rice agri-\nculture – reduced yields from a lack of water and salinity\nintrusion – would also be similar in the RRD.\n3.3.2 Freshwater ﬂooding\nRanked as the second most severe natural hazard after ty-\nphoons, freshwater ﬂoods are caused by overﬂowing rivers or\nheavy monsoonal rains or associated with heavy rain from ty-\nphoons (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Hung et al., 2012; McElwee\net al., 2017). Theoretically, ﬂooding reduces rice growing ar-\neas, but it is simplistic to assume that ﬂooded ﬁelds result in\nimmediate loss of rice crops. A study by Kotera et al. (2005)\nin the RRD showed that the type of rice, stage of rice growth,\nand lengths and depths of submergence were factors that in-\nﬂuence the survival rates of rice crops. For example, the local\nvariety Moc Tuyen was less resilient to submergence than\nthe two other genetically improved high-yielding varieties.\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

"""What factors influence the extent of agricultural damage caused by typhoons in Vietnam, and how does the timing and location of the typhoon's landfall affect this?"""	The extent of agricultural damage caused by typhoons in Vietnam is influenced by several factors. These include the strength of the typhoon, which is associated with higher wind speeds, more rainfall, larger waves, and higher storm surges. However, the quantity of agricultural losses also depends on the location of the typhoon's landfall and the timing of the typhoon, particularly if it occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting periods for crops. For instance, Typhoon Mirinae in 2016 made landfall in Nam Dinh and damaged or submerged a significant area of rice, while Typhoon Nesat in 2011 made landfall in Hai Phong with a similar intensity but caused significantly less rice damage. The shift in typhoon activity from north to south as the year progresses also plays a role, with peak activity in the north and southern part of Vietnam occurring in August and November, respectively.	['Addition-\nally, strong winds damage rice plants, with both effects con-\ntributing to a reduction in rice yields (Fig.6).Although a stronger typhoon usually brings higher wind\nspeeds, more rainfall, larger waves and higher storm surges\n(Larson et al., 2014), the quantity of agricultural losses de-\npends on factors such as landfall location(s) and whether the\ntyphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting\nperiods (Masutomi et al., 2012).For example, Typhoon Miri-\nnae (2016), which made landfall in Nam Dinh as a tropical\nstorm, damaged or submerged 225 216 ha of rice.Meanwhile\nTyphoon Nesat (2011) made landfall in Hai Phong with a\nsimilar intensity and caused only 3500 ha of rice damage.Conversely, Typhoon Kalmai (2014) made landfall in Quang\nNinh as a slightly stronger category 1 storm and caused\n20 000 ha of rice damage (Nhân Dân, 2014; United Nations\nVietnam, 2016; Viêt Nam News, 2011).An average of ﬁve to six typhoons affect Vietnam be-\ntween June and November every year (Larson et al., 2014;\nNguyen et al., 2007).Typhoon activity shifts from the north\nto the south as the year progresses.Therefore, peak activ-\nity in the north and southern part of Vietnam is in August\nand November, respectively (Imamura and Van To, 1997).We reviewed the Digital Typhoon (2021) database and found\n303 typhoons that came within 500 km of Vietnam’s coast-\nline from 1995 to 2018.A total of 29 cyclones made their\ninitial landfall in the Red River Delta, while only 4 cyclones\nmade landfall in the Mekong River Delta during the study pe-\nriod – one each in 1973, 1996, 1997 and 2006 (unpublished\nresults).Although the MRD is less prone to typhoons, two\nof the most recent typhoons caused signiﬁcant damage de-\nspite each being classiﬁed as a tropical storm upon landfall.Typhoon Linda (1997) caused some 349 232 ha of rice to be\nsubmerged, while Typhoon Durian (2006) damaged 6978 ha\nof agricultural land (International Federation of Red Cross\nand Red Crescent Society, 2006; UN Department of Human-\nitarian Affairs, 1997).Lastly, typhoons may not necessarily be bad all the time.Darby et al.(2016) combined suspended sediment load data\nfrom the Mekong River with hydrological model simulations\nto examine the role of typhoons in transporting suspended\nsediments and found that one-third (32 %) of the suspended\nsediment reaching the delta is delivered by runoff generated\nby rainfall associated with typhoons.When a typhoon affects\nareas upstream, the land receives higher-than-usual levels of\nrainfall, which may trigger landslides.This sediment can be\ntransferred into rivers and delivered downstream.While the\nrole of tropical typhoons in sediment mobilization is unclear\ngiven the lack of research in this area, such ﬁndings have\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'K.

Based on the context, what are some of the pests and diseases that can affect rice production in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	Rice production in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam can be affected by various pests and diseases. Pests include the brown planthopper, whitebacked planthopper, and small brown planthopper, which not only damage plants by ingesting their sap but also transmit pathogenic viruses that kill the plants. Other pests that affect rice include parasitic worms called nematodes, such as the rice root nematode, rice root knot nematode, and stem nematodes. Rice leaf folders, rice thrips, and stem borers are also significant pests. As for diseases, common ones include bacterial leaf blight, bakanae, black rot of grain, brown spot, leaf yellowing disease, neck blast, rice blast disease, root rot, sheath blight, sheath rot, and stem rot. These pests and diseases can severely reduce rice yield, as seen between 2005 and 2008 when outbreaks of brown planthopper and associated diseases significantly reduced rice production.	['1484 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nimportant implications for the MRD as sand mining and up-\nstream dams have caused sharp declines in ﬂuvial sediment\nloads, with corresponding impacts on channel incision and\nﬂood frequencies (Brunier et al., 2014; Rubin et al., 2015;\nPark et al., 2020).3.3.4 Pests and diseases\nExamples of pests that occur in rice ﬁelds of Vietnam in-\nclude the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens Stål),\nwhitebacked planthopper (WBPH; Sogatella furcifera Hor-\nvath) and small brown planthopper (SBPH; Laodelphax stri-\natellus Fallen).These planthoppers not only damage plants\nby ingesting its sap; they also transmit pathogenic viruses\nthat kill the plants.The BPH is a vector for the rice grassy\nstunt virus (RGSV) and the rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV);\nthe WBPH transmits the southern rice black streaked dwarf\nvirus (RBSDV), while the SBPH vectors the rice stripe\nvirus (RSV) and the RBSDV (Bottrell and Schoenly, 2012;\nMatsukawa-Nakata et al., 2019).Other pests that affect\nrice include parasitic worms called nematodes.Root nema-\ntodes that affect deepwater and irrigated rice ﬁelds in the\nMRD include Hirschmanniella oryzae (rice root nematode),\nHirschmanniella mucronata andMeloidogyne graminicola\n(rice root knot nematode).Stem nematodes like the Dity-\nlenchus angustus infect ﬂoating, deepwater and rainfed low-\nland rice in the MRD (Nguyen and Prot, 1995).Other signif-\nicant pests of rice in Vietnam include rice leaf folders, rice\nthrips and stem borers (Sebesvari et al., 2011).Meanwhile,\ncommon rice diseases include bacterial leaf blight, bakanae,\nblack rot of grain, brown spot, leaf yellowing disease, neck\nblast, rice blast disease, root rot, sheath blight, sheath rot\nand stem rot (Pinnschmid et al., 1995; Sebesvari et al., 2011;\nTrung et al., 1995; Kim et al., 1995).Between 2005 and 2008, rice production in the Mekong\nRiver Delta was severely reduced by outbreaks of brown\nplanthopper and the associated virulent diseases.The prob-\nlem was particularly severe in An Giang, Dong Thap and\nTien Giang provinces, with more than 50 % of the cultivated\nareas affected (Berg and Tam, 2012).In 2009, the south-\nern rice black streaked dwarf virus affected 19 provinces in\nnorthern Vietnam, including those in the Red River Delta.More than 80 % of the rice ﬁelds in Nam Dinh, Nghe An,\nQuang Ninh and Thai Binh provinces were infested, and\nyield was non-existent (Hoang et al., 2011).In short, an in-\ncrease in pest and/or disease outbreaks will likely cause a\nreduction in rice yield (Fig.6).3.4 Global natural-hazard driver\nSea level rise (SLR)\nBesides creating new environmental challenges, pre-existing\nthreats to rice production and food security will be exacer-\nbated by climate change.One of the effects of climate changeis rising sea levels.Globally, the Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC) has projected sea levels to rise\nfrom a rate of 3.2 mm yr−1from 1993 to 2010 to as much as\n10 mm yr−1or more by 2010 (Church et al., 2013).This may\nresult in a 0.98 m increase in sea level by 2100 (Lassa et al.,\n2016).To quantify sea level rise locally, observations at tide\ngauges across Vietnam have recorded an average yearly in-\ncrease of 3.3 mm from 1993–2014 (Hens et al., 2018).SLR\nmay also increase the risk of storm surges (Hanh and Fu-\nrukawa, 2007).In the Red River Delta, Neumann et al.', '1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.']
Based on the report, how could rising sea levels and accelerated coastal subsidence due to excessive groundwater extraction potentially impact the salinity levels and rice production in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	Rising sea levels and accelerated coastal subsidence due to excessive groundwater extraction could potentially lead to large portions of the low-lying areas in the Mekong Delta being inundated and flooded. This could facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, which may increase salinity gradients in the region. Salinity intrusion could worsen during the dry season, affecting approximately 1.8 million hectares in the Mekong Delta, of which 1.3 million hectares is affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1. This area is predicted to increase to 2.2 million hectares with rising sea levels. Increased soil salinization could lead to a loss of land available for rice production. Even though there are sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices in place to reduce incursions of seawater, they may be inadequate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.	['(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'While groundwater extraction has increased the availability\nof water for human activities, it has exacerbated land subsi-\ndence, which has increased the severity and extent of salt-\nwater intrusion and reduced the suitability of land for rice\ncultivation (Fig.4).Minderhoud et al.(2017) developed a\n3D numerical groundwater ﬂow model of the MRD surface\nand found that subsidence rates from groundwater extraction\nwere between 1.1 and 2.5 cm yr−1.The model also showed\nthat 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 had re-\nsulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence, with\nsome hotspots recording over 30 cm of subsidence.Land sub-\nsidence from excessive groundwater extraction acts as a cat-\nalyst that increases vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and\nreduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.Moreover, rice crops become contaminated with arsenic\nwhen arsenic-rich groundwater used for non-agricultural use\nis discharged into rivers, and the river water is used for rice ir-\nrigation (Lan and Giao, 2017; Minderhoud et al., 2018).High\narsenic concentrations in groundwater seem to be of natu-\nral origin.In the Mekong River Delta, naturally occurring\nbiochemical and hydrological processes cause As to be re-\nleased from Fe oxides in rocks and sediments into groundwa-\nter reservoirs (Fendorf et al., 2010).In addition, deep ground-\nwater extraction causes interbedded clays to compact and ex-\npel water containing dissolved As (Erban et al., 2013).Crop\nquality is reduced when the arsenic-enriched water is de-\nposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth\n(Rahman and Hasegawa, 2011; Fig.4).Similarly, prevalence of groundwater extraction is also\nhigh in the Red River Delta.Approximately 70 % of the\npopulation living in the RRD accesses water from Holocene\nand Pleistocene aquifers (Berg et al., 2007; Winkel et al.,\n2011).Groundwater in the Red River Delta is also contam-\ninated with high levels of As due to reductive dissolution\nof As from iron oxyhydroxides in buried sediment (Berg et\nal., 2007; Luu, 2019).Berg et al.(2007) sampled 196 tube\nwells randomly over a 700 km2area in the Red River Delta,\nand the concentrations of As in groundwater ranged from\n1 to 3050 µg L−1, with an average of 159 µg L−1.Separately,\nWinkel et al.(2011) collected 512 water samples from pri-\nvate wells in the Red River ﬂoodplain and found As concen-\ntrations varying from <0.1 to 810 µg L−1, with 27 % of the\nsamples exceeding the WHO guideline value of 10 µg L−1.Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021']
"""What are the potential impacts of salinity intrusion on rice production in the Mekong Delta, and how might climate change exacerbate these effects?"""	Salinity intrusion can have detrimental effects on rice production in the Mekong Delta. It can lead to a reduction in the quality and quantity of rice produced. Climate change could exacerbate these effects by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as typhoons and sea level rise, which can induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion. Droughts, which may also become more frequent due to climate change, can worsen the extent of salinity intrusion due to a lack of fresh water. Furthermore, climate change could potentially reduce rice growing areas in the future due to a substantial reduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams, coupled with the process of land subsidence from groundwater extraction and rising sea levels.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', 'Chan, F.

"""What are the potential negative impacts of converting paddy fields to shrimp ponds in terms of soil salinity and availability of fresh water in the Mekong Delta?"""	The conversion of paddy fields to shrimp ponds can increase soil salinity and reduce the availability of fresh water. Over time, this can make it difficult for neighboring farmers who have not switched to aquaculture to plant rice, forcing them to seek alternative livelihoods. Additionally, the environmental conditions in these rice-shrimp systems can be suboptimal, contributing to low yields and survival. For instance, water temperature and salinity can be too high in the dry season, and dissolved oxygen too low, causing most shrimps to die. For rice, the high soil salinity caused by having the aquaculture pond can be a major limitation.	['1486 K. W.

"""What are the impacts of land-use patterns and natural hazards on rice agriculture in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam, and how have these factors affected the demand for aquaculture and alternative crops?"""	Land-use patterns and natural hazards have significant impacts on rice agriculture in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam. Environmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion have limited rice production areas and forced many farmers to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or to grow salt-tolerant crops like coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion has also reduced rice growing areas. However, agricultural intensification has kept rice yields high despite shrinking growing areas. The construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields, but these dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Rice crops are also susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as typhoons, floods, and droughts. These factors have affected the demand for aquaculture and alternative crops. Higher prices and rising demand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incentivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to embrace non-rice crops. Despite official encouragement to move away from triple-cropping, most farmers have largely ignored the directive as they preferred to earn money from the additional rice crop. Farmers are willing to make changes to their farming practices only if it benefits them.	['1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.', 'However, a study by\nTran and Weger (2018) in An Giang Province revealed that\ndespite ofﬁcial encouragement to move away from triple-\ncropping, most farmers have largely ignored the directive as\nthey preferred to earn money from the additional rice crop.In addition, many of them felt that the beneﬁts of ﬂooding\nthe land were minimal as upstream dams have drastically re-\nduced fertile sediment and ﬁsh.Evidently, farmers are will-\ning to make changes to their farming practices only if it ben-\neﬁts them.To mitigate “wicked” environmental challenges, there is\na need for holistic land-use planning and soft measures\n(e.g., implementing crop and land-use change) on top of\nhard engineering structures.Previously, management options\nto increase agricultural productivity and mitigate the threats\nposed by natural hazards were largely characterized by hard\noptions such as the construction of dikes, sea walls and sluice\ngates.These were typically top-down projects spearheaded\nby the local government (Neumann et al., 2015; Smajgl et\nal., 2015).While highly visible engineering structures are\neasily constructed and generally effective, unwanted side ef-\nfects may be created.For example, ﬂooding and sediment\nexclusion were some problems that were inadvertently cre-\nated due to the presence of high dikes.In the long term,\n(costly) maintenance is needed to maintain the functional-\nity of engineered structures (Hoang et al., 2018; Neumann\net al., 2015).In addition, during the pre-construction phase,\nnatural vegetation may be cleared (Geist and Lambin, 2002).Adopting a systems-thinking approach would allow policy-\nmakers and managers to situate the range of mitigation mea-\nsures within broader environmental processes.In doing so, a\nclearer view of the possibilities and challenges present in an\nera of widespread anthropogenic development and changing\nclimates is provided.5 Conclusions\nThe focus of this paper is on the impacts of land-use patterns\nand natural hazards on rice agriculture in the Mekong and\nRed River deltas in Vietnam.While we focused on rice agri-\nculture, these two deltas, like many other deltas worldwide,\nare also major production hubs for fruits and vegetables (Day\net al., 2016; Nhan and Cao, 2019).Hence, the natural hazards\nand anthropogenic factors listed will have an effect on other\nagricultural produce as well.A key ﬁnding is that demand for aquaculture and alterna-\ntive crops and urban expansion has diminished rice growing\nareas.The problem of shrinking agricultural land is amelio-\nrated by agricultural intensiﬁcation, which has increased land\nefﬁciency.However, widespread agrochemical use causes\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021']
"""How do human activities and natural hazards, such as typhoons and sea level rise, contribute to saltwater flooding and worsen salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how might these issues be exacerbated by climate change?"""	Human activities such as the construction of dikes and embankments, sand mining, upstream dams, and groundwater extraction can contribute to saltwater flooding and worsen salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta. Dikes and embankments are designed to keep out floodwaters and salt intrusion, but they can reduce fertile silt deposits. Sand mining and upstream dams can reduce the frequency of natural freshwater flooding and affect sediment accumulation. Groundwater extraction can cause land subsidence, which can lead to saltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination. Natural hazards like typhoons and sea level rise can also contribute to these issues. Typhoons can induce saltwater flooding and aggravate salinity intrusion. Sea level rise, coupled with land subsidence from groundwater extraction, can lead to large portions of the low-lying Mekong Delta being inundated and flooded, facilitating the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers and increasing salinity gradients. Climate change could exacerbate these problems by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters like typhoons and by causing sea levels to rise. This could lead to more frequent and severe saltwater flooding and saltwater intrusion, and could potentially reduce rice growing areas in the future.	['K. W.

"""What are the potential impacts of decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise on the survival of the Mekong Delta, as mentioned in the report?"""	Decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise can have significant impacts on the survival of the Mekong Delta. These factors can lead to increased recurrence of storm surges, with the current 100-year storm surge with a 5m height potentially occurring once every 49 years. This can result in breaches in dikes and embankments, leading to saltwater flooding that can damage rice growing areas and other properties. Rising sea levels, along with accelerated coastal subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction, can cause large portions of the low-lying areas to be inundated and flooded. This can facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients. Salinity intrusion can worsen during the dry season, affecting large areas of land. Increased soil salinization can lead to a loss of land available for rice production. Even though there are sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices in place to reduce incursions of seawater, they may be inadequate if not well maintained and upgraded. Furthermore, the expansion of aquaculture, alternative crops, and urban expansion can negatively affect rice growing areas. However, agricultural intensification can potentially offset some of these impacts.

Based on the context, what are the potential impacts of river-bed mining on the destabilisation of the Mekong and Bassac river channels in the Mekong Delta?	River-bed mining, or sand mining, can have several destabilizing effects on the Mekong and Bassac river channels in the Mekong Delta. The extraction process removes large quantities of riverbed sediments and creates numerous pits and pools, which can be up to 45 meters deep. These pits and pools act as sediment traps, preventing sediments from traveling downstream and contributing to the delta's growth. This can lead to bed incision, where the riverbanks are cut down due to the water being sediment-starved. This phenomenon can propagate upstream and downstream from the extraction sites, affecting river ecosystems over a large area and resulting in land loss, which threatens rice growing areas. Additionally, aggressive sand mining disrupts natural flooding. A study found that flood frequency in the Mekong River Delta dropped by 7.8% from 2005–2015 due to riverine mining. This disruption in flood regimes results in reduced volumes of water and sediments for agricultural production. Floodwaters typically deposit fertile sediments and flush out pesticides and fertilizers from intensive agricultural production. When flood frequency decreases, the frequency at which farmlands benefit from this natural soil quality enhancement also decreases. This could lead to a decrease in soil fertility over time and result in declines in rice yields unless artificial fertilizers are added.	['1480 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nLikewise, the RRD is also heavily diked, with 3000 km of\nriver dikes (Fig.5), but unlike the MRD, high dikes are ab-\nsent (Pilarcyzk and Nguyen, 2005).Besides river and ﬂood\ncontrol dikes, there are also sea dikes and salinization pre-\nvention dikes in both deltas to protect the area from salinity\nintrusion.There are 1500 km of sea and estuary dikes in the\nRRD.In the MRD, there are 1290 km of salinization preven-\ntion dikes and 450 km of sea dikes (Le et al., 2018; Pilarczyk\nand Nguyen, 2005; Fig.4).3.1.4 Sand mining\nSand mining is carried out on a large scale in the Mekong\n(Kondolf et al., 2018).Fueled by demand from reclamation,\nexport and construction, 55.2 million tonnes of sediment\nwas extracted from the Mekong main stem in Laos, Thai-\nland, Cambodia and Vietnam from 2011 to 2012 (Bravard\nand Gaillot, 2013; Robert, 2017).A more recent analysis of\nbathymetric maps and the local reﬁlling processes by Jor-\ndan et al.(2019) put the amount of sand extracted from the\nMekong River Delta in 2018 at 17.77 Mm3.Besides removing large quantities of riverbed sediments,\nsand mining operations have created numerous pits and\npools.These pits and pools, which can be up to 45 m deep,\nthen become sediment traps, trapping bed loads from up-\nstream reaches and preventing them from traveling down-\nstream and contributing to the continued presence and\ngrowth of the delta.In addition, bed incision also occurs\nas the water is sediment-starved.The down-cutting of river-\nbanks can propagate upstream and downstream from the ex-\ntraction sites for many kilometers, in turn affecting river\necosystems over a large area (Kondolf et al., 2018).This bank\nincision results in land loss, which threatens rice growing ar-\neas (Fig.4).Aggressive sand mining also disrupts natural ﬂooding.A\nrecent study of the effects of riverine mining on ﬂood fre-\nquency in the Long Xuyen Quadrangle (LXQ) in the Mekong\nRiver Delta found that ﬂood frequency had dropped by 7.8 %\nfrom 2005–2015.Water levels at local gauge stations also\nshowed an overall decreasing trend, indicating that the low-\nering of the riverbed had reduced the frequency of ﬂooding.Disrupted ﬂood regimes result in reduced volumes of water\nand sediments for agricultural production.In addition, ﬂood-\nwaters typically deposit fertile sediments while ﬂushing the\npesticides and fertilizers accumulated from intensive agricul-\ntural production.When the ﬂood frequency decreases, the\nfrequency at which farmlands beneﬁt from this natural soil\nquality enhancement decreases.Consequently, soil fertility\nmay decrease over time and lead to declines in rice yields un-\nless artiﬁcial fertilizers are added (Park et al., 2020; Fig.4).While there are several studies on the diffuse, yet insidious\nnature of sand mining in the Mekong (cf.Bravard and Gail-\nlot, 2013; Brunier et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2019; Kondolf\net al., 2018; Park et al., 2020; Robert, 2017; Schmitt et al.,\n2017), the extent of sand mining in the Red River Delta isunclear as there is almost no research on this issue.We did\nhowever come across an article in a Vietnamese newspaper\nabout rampant sand mining in the Red River and how min-\ning operations have caused erosion in nearby villages (Chinh,\n2018).Similar to the situation in the MRD, the authorities\nhave turned a blind eye to this illegal business (Bravard and\nGaillot, 2013; Chinh, 2018).3.1.5 Groundwater extraction\nAnother example of an anthropogenic development creating\nother interrelated problems is that of groundwater extraction.', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

"""What are the sustainable adaptation strategies for rice agriculture in the Mekong Delta's An Giang Province, Vietnam, in the face of climate change and its effects such as salinity intrusion?"""	The sustainable adaptation strategies for rice agriculture in the Mekong Delta's An Giang Province, Vietnam, in the face of climate change and its effects such as salinity intrusion include the use of system dynamics modelling. This approach helps in evaluating the sustainability of different adaptation strategies. Additionally, sustainable rice cultivation practices have been implemented in the deep flooded zones of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. These strategies aim to balance the need for rice production with the challenges posed by climate change and environmental factors.	['Chan, F. K. S., Friess, D. A., Terry, J.

"""Based on the report, what are the potential impacts of pumping-induced land subsidence on the release of arsenic to deep groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?"""	Pumping-induced land subsidence can increase the vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and reduce the availability of land suitable for rice production. When arsenic-rich groundwater, used for non-agricultural purposes, is discharged into rivers and used for rice irrigation, it can contaminate the rice crops with arsenic. This is because deep groundwater extraction can cause interbedded clays to compact and expel water containing dissolved arsenic. The arsenic-enriched water can then be deposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth, reducing crop quality.	['While groundwater extraction has increased the availability\nof water for human activities, it has exacerbated land subsi-\ndence, which has increased the severity and extent of salt-\nwater intrusion and reduced the suitability of land for rice\ncultivation (Fig.4).Minderhoud et al.(2017) developed a\n3D numerical groundwater ﬂow model of the MRD surface\nand found that subsidence rates from groundwater extraction\nwere between 1.1 and 2.5 cm yr−1.The model also showed\nthat 25 years of groundwater extraction since 1991 had re-\nsulted in a cumulative average of 18 cm of subsidence, with\nsome hotspots recording over 30 cm of subsidence.Land sub-\nsidence from excessive groundwater extraction acts as a cat-\nalyst that increases vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and\nreduces the availability of land suitable for rice production.Moreover, rice crops become contaminated with arsenic\nwhen arsenic-rich groundwater used for non-agricultural use\nis discharged into rivers, and the river water is used for rice ir-\nrigation (Lan and Giao, 2017; Minderhoud et al., 2018).High\narsenic concentrations in groundwater seem to be of natu-\nral origin.In the Mekong River Delta, naturally occurring\nbiochemical and hydrological processes cause As to be re-\nleased from Fe oxides in rocks and sediments into groundwa-\nter reservoirs (Fendorf et al., 2010).In addition, deep ground-\nwater extraction causes interbedded clays to compact and ex-\npel water containing dissolved As (Erban et al., 2013).Crop\nquality is reduced when the arsenic-enriched water is de-\nposited on topsoils and absorbed by rice plants during growth\n(Rahman and Hasegawa, 2011; Fig.4).Similarly, prevalence of groundwater extraction is also\nhigh in the Red River Delta.Approximately 70 % of the\npopulation living in the RRD accesses water from Holocene\nand Pleistocene aquifers (Berg et al., 2007; Winkel et al.,\n2011).Groundwater in the Red River Delta is also contam-\ninated with high levels of As due to reductive dissolution\nof As from iron oxyhydroxides in buried sediment (Berg et\nal., 2007; Luu, 2019).Berg et al.(2007) sampled 196 tube\nwells randomly over a 700 km2area in the Red River Delta,\nand the concentrations of As in groundwater ranged from\n1 to 3050 µg L−1, with an average of 159 µg L−1.Separately,\nWinkel et al.(2011) collected 512 water samples from pri-\nvate wells in the Red River ﬂoodplain and found As concen-\ntrations varying from <0.1 to 810 µg L−1, with 27 % of the\nsamples exceeding the WHO guideline value of 10 µg L−1.Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1481\nThe high concentrations of As reduce the quality of rice har-\nvested in the RRD if As gets into soils and river waters indi-\nrectly through the usage of As-enriched groundwater (Fig.4).In a study on As accumulation in white rice from the Red\nRiver region in Vietnam, Phuong et al.(1999) reported As\nvalues of between 0.03 and 0.47 µg g−1d wt with the mean\nvalue at 0.21 µg g−1d wt.The mean value was higher than the\nmean value reported for Thai rice (0.14 µg g−1d wt; range:\n0.01 to 0.39 µg g−1) (Meharg et al., 2009).Lastly, although high As concentrations in groundwater\nare common in the RRD (cf.Berg et al., 2007; Luu, 2019;\nH. V .Pham et al., 2018; Winkel et al., 2011), there is no re-\nsearch on (groundwater induced) land subsidence in the Red\nRiver Delta.Thus, the magnitude of land subsidence in the\ndelta is uncertain and should be an area for future research.3.2 Regional anthropogenic drivers\n3.2.1 Upstream dams\nThe Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau and\nﬂows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo-\ndia and southern Vietnam.To meet growing demands for\nelectricity, many small- and large-scale hydropower projects\nhave been commissioned in each country to take advantage\nof this supposedly green and clean source of energy (Nhan\nand Cao, 2019; Manh et al., 2015).A total of 241 dams\nhave been completed in the entire Mekong basin, with an-\nother 29 under construction.A further 91 are currently be-\ning planned.These 361 dams consist of 176 hydropower\ndams and 185 irrigation dams.Of the 364 dams in the\nMekong, 20 are in Vietnamese territory (WLE Mekong\nCGIAR, 2020a).Conversely, the Red River originates in\nYunnan Province in China and ﬂows towards northern Viet-\nnam.It is less heavily dammed, with a total of 105 dams in\nChina and Vietnam.There are 25 hydropower dams, 3 multi-\npurpose dams and 9 irrigation dams in the Red River basin in\nVietnam (Vinh et al., 2014; WLE Mekong CGIAR, 2020b).While there are no dams in the Mekong River Delta or the\nRed River Delta due to their relatively ﬂat elevation, up-\nstream dam development inﬂuences downstream regions in\nmany ways, with the environmental impacts extending far\nbeyond the dam itself (Kondolf et al., 2014).Firstly, a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel and\nsuspended sediment is impounded in reservoirs behind the\ndams instead of being transported downstream.This dimin-\nished sediment load may aggravate erosion downstream from\nthe dam (Nhan and Cao, 2019; Fig.4).Using a network\nmodel, under a “deﬁnitive future” scenario of 38 new dams,\nthe cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River\nDelta would be 51 %.Conversely, under full build-up of\n133 new dams, only 4 % of the pre-dam sediment load will\nreach the delta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Manh et al.(2015)\nalso reached similar conclusions with a quasi-2D hydrody-\nnamic model of suspended sediment dynamics.Floodplainsedimentation would decrease by about 21 % to 96 %, while\nsediment load supplied to the sea at the river will diminish by\n1 % to 95 %, with the extreme values representing full dam\nbuild-up.Even if dam construction was limited to the river\ntributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment\ntrapped could be as high as 68 %, meaning that only about\n32 % of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River\nDelta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Indeed, Binh et al.(2020) found that the suspended sed-\niment loads in the MRD had decreased by 74.1 % in 2012–\n2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang\ncascade in China.']
What are the potential impacts of sea level rise on the coastal zone of Vietnam, particularly in the context of the Mekong Delta region?	The potential impacts of sea level rise on the coastal zone of Vietnam, particularly in the Mekong Delta region, include increased flood risks and salinity intrusion. Changes in climate conditions can also affect rice production in the region. Infrastructure effects on floods in the Mekong River Delta have also been studied. Additionally, the region has seen a decrease in flood frequency due to river-bed mining and dyke construction. These changes can have significant impacts on the local agrarian communities and their livelihoods.	['Hens, L., Thinh, N. A., Hanh, T. H., Cuong, N. S., Lan, T. D.,\nThanh, N. V ., and Le, D.

Based on the provided context, what are the potential impacts of infrastructure on flood occurrences in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	The construction of dams upstream can significantly impact flood occurrences in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam. These dams trap a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel, and suspended sediment in reservoirs, which would otherwise be transported downstream. This reduction in sediment load can exacerbate erosion downstream from the dam. Under certain scenarios, the cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River Delta could be as high as 51% or even 96%, which could significantly alter the river's dynamics and potentially increase flood risks.

W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1481\nThe high concentrations of As reduce the quality of rice har-\nvested in the RRD if As gets into soils and river waters indi-\nrectly through the usage of As-enriched groundwater (Fig.4).In a study on As accumulation in white rice from the Red\nRiver region in Vietnam, Phuong et al.(1999) reported As\nvalues of between 0.03 and 0.47 µg g−1d wt with the mean\nvalue at 0.21 µg g−1d wt.The mean value was higher than the\nmean value reported for Thai rice (0.14 µg g−1d wt; range:\n0.01 to 0.39 µg g−1) (Meharg et al., 2009).Lastly, although high As concentrations in groundwater\nare common in the RRD (cf.Berg et al., 2007; Luu, 2019;\nH. V .Pham et al., 2018; Winkel et al., 2011), there is no re-\nsearch on (groundwater induced) land subsidence in the Red\nRiver Delta.Thus, the magnitude of land subsidence in the\ndelta is uncertain and should be an area for future research.3.2 Regional anthropogenic drivers\n3.2.1 Upstream dams\nThe Mekong River originates in the Tibetan Plateau and\nﬂows through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambo-\ndia and southern Vietnam.To meet growing demands for\nelectricity, many small- and large-scale hydropower projects\nhave been commissioned in each country to take advantage\nof this supposedly green and clean source of energy (Nhan\nand Cao, 2019; Manh et al., 2015).A total of 241 dams\nhave been completed in the entire Mekong basin, with an-\nother 29 under construction.A further 91 are currently be-\ning planned.These 361 dams consist of 176 hydropower\ndams and 185 irrigation dams.Of the 364 dams in the\nMekong, 20 are in Vietnamese territory (WLE Mekong\nCGIAR, 2020a).Conversely, the Red River originates in\nYunnan Province in China and ﬂows towards northern Viet-\nnam.It is less heavily dammed, with a total of 105 dams in\nChina and Vietnam.There are 25 hydropower dams, 3 multi-\npurpose dams and 9 irrigation dams in the Red River basin in\nVietnam (Vinh et al., 2014; WLE Mekong CGIAR, 2020b).While there are no dams in the Mekong River Delta or the\nRed River Delta due to their relatively ﬂat elevation, up-\nstream dam development inﬂuences downstream regions in\nmany ways, with the environmental impacts extending far\nbeyond the dam itself (Kondolf et al., 2014).Firstly, a substantial amount of coarse sand, gravel and\nsuspended sediment is impounded in reservoirs behind the\ndams instead of being transported downstream.This dimin-\nished sediment load may aggravate erosion downstream from\nthe dam (Nhan and Cao, 2019; Fig.4).Using a network\nmodel, under a “deﬁnitive future” scenario of 38 new dams,\nthe cumulative sediment reduction in the Mekong River\nDelta would be 51 %.Conversely, under full build-up of\n133 new dams, only 4 % of the pre-dam sediment load will\nreach the delta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Manh et al.(2015)\nalso reached similar conclusions with a quasi-2D hydrody-\nnamic model of suspended sediment dynamics.Floodplainsedimentation would decrease by about 21 % to 96 %, while\nsediment load supplied to the sea at the river will diminish by\n1 % to 95 %, with the extreme values representing full dam\nbuild-up.Even if dam construction was limited to the river\ntributaries instead of the main stem, the cumulative sediment\ntrapped could be as high as 68 %, meaning that only about\n32 % of the sediment load would reach the Mekong River\nDelta (Kondolf et al., 2014).Indeed, Binh et al.(2020) found that the suspended sed-\niment loads in the MRD had decreased by 74.1 % in 2012–\n2015 primarily due to six mainstream dams in the Lancang\ncascade in China.']

The context does not provide specific details on the regional consequences of seawater intrusion on rice productivity and land use in the coastal area of the Mekong River Delta according to the report by Kotera, Sakamoto, Nguyen, and Yokozawa.	['K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.', '1490 K.

"""What are the impacts of land use and human activities on the Mekong Delta over the last 40 years, and how might these changes affect the quality of groundwater in Vietnam?"""	Over the last 40 years, land use and human activities have had significant impacts on the Mekong Delta. Industrial water pollution has been identified as a cause of rice yield loss in Vietnam. Additionally, sand mining activities have led to local sediment deficits. The construction of dams on the Mekong has resulted in cumulative sediment starvation. Urban expansion, particularly in areas like Can Tho city, has also been noted. These changes can potentially affect the quality of groundwater in Vietnam. For instance, arsenic contamination in groundwater in the Red River delta has been reported. Furthermore, the conversion of agricultural land in peri-urban areas could also influence groundwater quality. However, the specific impacts on groundwater quality due to these changes in the Mekong Delta would require further research.

What are the drivers of change and potential adaptation pathways for agricultural systems in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam, facing increased salinity intrusion due to climate change?	The drivers of change in the agricultural systems in the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam include climate change, land-use change, and natural disasters. These changes have led to increased salinity intrusion, particularly affecting rice production. Potential adaptation pathways for these agricultural systems could involve implementing sustainable adaptation strategies, such as system dynamics modelling for vulnerable mega-deltas. Additionally, sustainable rice cultivation in deep flooded zones could be another adaptation strategy. It's also important to address issues like illegal sand mining and damming, which can exacerbate the impacts of climate change and salinity intrusion.

"""What are the impacts of salinity intrusion on rice production in the Red River Delta under changing climate conditions, as mentioned in the context?"""	Salinity intrusion, which is expected to worsen with rising sea levels and during the dry season, can have significant impacts on rice production in the Red River Delta (RRD). This intrusion facilitates the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients in the RRD. This can lead to increased soil salinization, resulting in a loss of land available for rice production. In the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1% salinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km. While there are sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices in place to reduce seawater incursions, they may be inadequate if not well maintained and upgraded. Furthermore, climate change may exacerbate the effects of natural hazards, potentially intensifying problems such as excessive saltwater flooding and saltwater intrusion.	['(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture 1485\nhigh agrochemical inputs, it was possible to maximize rice\nyields in spite of a smaller growing area.However excessive\nagrochemical use affects rice quality and may have an op-\nposite effect on the prevalence of pests and diseases.Next,\nanthropogenic developments meant to improve agricultural\nproductivity or increase economic growth can create many\nunwanted environmental consequences.Dikes keep ﬂoodwa-\nters and salt intrusion out, but there is a reduction in fertile\nsilt deposits.Sand mining increases channel erosion and re-\nduces the frequency of natural freshwater ﬂooding.Similar\nto sand mining, upstream dams affect sediment accumula-\ntion as sediments are trapped in reservoirs upstream, but the\nimpacts of upstream dams extend over a larger geographical\narea.Lastly, groundwater extraction causes land subsidence,\nsaltwater intrusion and arsenic contamination, with negative\nfeedbacks on rice growing areas and the quality of rice pro-\nduced.Natural hazards not only affect rice quality and quantity\nbut may also amplify some of the problems created by hu-\nman activities; for instance, typhoons and sea level rise may\ninduce saltwater ﬂooding and aggravate salinity intrusion.Conversely, droughts also worsen the extent of salinity in-\ntrusion but due to a lack of fresh water.Overall, a substantial\nreduction in sediment from sand mining and upstream dams,\ncoupled with the process of land subsidence from ground-\nwater extraction and rising sea levels, will potentially reduce\nrice growing areas in the future.Besides sea level rise, cli-\nmate change may also exacerbate the effects of natural haz-\nards by increasing the frequency and severity of natural dis-\nasters (cf.Hausfather et al., 2017; Grosjean et al., 2016; Terry\net al., 2012).As such, the problems such as excessive saltwa-\nter ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion may intensify.The use of ﬂow diagrams provides a visual overview of\nthe key anthropogenic drivers and natural hazards that affect\nrice production, but we caution that the Red River Delta and\nthe Mekong River Delta are vast and diverse regions, and\nthere are differences in the ways each delta is affected by\nnatural hazards and anthropogenic drivers.For example, high\ndikes and the associated problem of sediment exclusion are\na problem unique to the Mekong River Delta (Chapman et\nal., 2017).Next, compared to the Mekong, the Red River has\nsubstantially fewer dams (361 vs. 105).In addition, typhoons\nare less common in the Mekong River Delta, and droughts\noccur less frequently in the Red River Delta.Within each delta, typhoons tend to affect coastal\nprovinces more than those farther inland.Similarly, arsenic\ncontamination and saltwater intrusion are not an issue ev-\nerywhere across the two deltas.A comparison study of ar-\nsenic pollution in the Mekong and Red River deltas showed\nthat groundwater arsenic concentrations ranged from 1–\n845 µg L−1in the MRD and from 1–3050 µg L−1in the RRD.Hotspots with high arsenic concentrations were likely due\nto local geogenic conditions (Berg et al., 2007).For salin-\nity intrusion, Kotera et al.(2005) measured salinity concen-\ntrations in river and canal water across four Mekong RiverDelta provinces and showed that the salinity levels ranged\nfrom 0.6 to 14.4 g L−1, while a localized study in the Nam\nDinh Province in the RRD showed that salt concentration in\nriver water was higher at the river mouth than in upstream\nlocations.Hence, given the possibility of spatial variations\nwithin a large landscape, it is important for local conditions\nto be taken into consideration.One limitation of our study is that it was not possible to\ninclude all the problems that can potentially affect rice culti-\nvation in our ﬂow diagrams.We acknowledge issues related\nto industrial pollution, which may reduce rice quality and\nrice productivity (Khai and Yabe, 2012, 2021; Huong et al.,\n2008).In spite of this, our study presents the major issues\nthat are common in both deltas and describes how the is-\nsues and processes affecting rice production are interrelated\nand may operate at different scales.']

"""What are the anticipated impacts of dam construction in the Mekong basin on the geomorphology of the Mekong Delta, according to Rubin, Kondolf, and Carling's study?"""	The context does not provide information on the anticipated impacts of dam construction in the Mekong basin on the geomorphology of the Mekong Delta according to Rubin, Kondolf, and Carling's study.	['In particular, the Manwan and Dachaoshan\ndams contributed to 32 % of the reduction.In addition,\nfrom 2014–2017, the average incision rate of the Tien River\nin the MRD was 3 times higher than the previously recorded\nvalue.Sand mining was responsible for a maximum of\n14.8 % of the annual riverbed incision, while the remainder\nwas caused by hydropower dams upstream.The deleterious impacts of dams on sediment loads can\nalso be found in the Red River Delta in spite of the smaller\nnumber of dams.While the Hoa Binh dam is located on a\ntributary of the Red River in Vietnam, its large size has in-\nﬂuenced suspended sediment distribution in the lower Red\nRiver basin.For example, an analysis of the suspended sedi-\nment concentration over a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010\nshowed that yearly suspended sediment ﬂux had dropped by\n61 % at Son Tay near Hanoi (Vinh et al., 2014).Similarly,\nDuc et al.(2012) calculated that the suspended sediment bud-\nget at Son Tay and Hanoi hydrological monitoring stations\nwas reduced by 56 % after the Hoa Binh dam became oper-\national in 1989.The reduction in sediment loads at the Red\nRiver Delta would likewise have a similar impact on delta\nsize and rice growing areas.Besides a change in sediment loads, dams also alter stream\ndischarge and water levels, with concurrent effects on wa-\nter supplies (not shown in Fig.4).When water levels are\nhigh during the rainy season, dams can be used to impound\nthe excess water in the reservoir behind.During the dry sea-\nson, when water levels are lower, the dams can release wa-\nter downstream.In doing so, dams increase dry-season dis-\ncharge and decrease wet-season discharge.The modiﬁcation\nof seasonal water ﬂows is problematic as changes in natu-\nral ﬂow patterns, such as higher ﬂows in the dry season and\nlower ﬂows in the wet season, would affect rice production\nas rice growing calendars are currently linked to the natu-\nral ﬂuctuations in high and low ﬂows (Robert, 2017).Hence,\nchanges in water levels due to anthropogenic interventions\nmay create unfavorable conditions for crop growth if plant-\ning calendars remain unchanged.In addition, lowered water\nlevels during dry seasons due to upstream water impound-\nment can also lead to increased saltwater intrusion and create\nunfavorable growing conditions for rice farmers.https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021 Nat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021', 'Jordan, C., Tiede, J., Lojek, O., Visscher, J., Apel, H., Nguyen,\nH.

"""What are the potential impacts of rising sea levels on the Mekong Delta, as discussed in the provided context?"""	Rising sea levels could have several impacts on the Mekong Delta. They could reduce the recurrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m height to once every 49 years. This could lead to breaches in inadequately constructed and poorly maintained dikes and embankments, resulting in saltwater flooding that damages rice growing areas and other properties. Rising sea levels, along with accelerated coastal subsidence caused by excessive groundwater extraction, could cause large portions of the low-lying areas to be inundated and flooded. This could facilitate the infiltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, increasing salinity gradients. Salinity intrusion could worsen during the dry season, affecting approximately 1.8 million ha in the Mekong Delta, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by salinity levels above 5 g L−1. This area is predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea levels. Increased soil salinization could lead to a loss of land available for rice production. Existing sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices may be inadequate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.	['(2015)\nfound that sea level rise through 2050 could reduce the recur-\nrence interval of the current 100-year storm surge with a 5 m\nheight to once every 49 years.Inadequately constructed and\npoorly maintained dikes and embankments may be breached,\nresulting in saltwater ﬂooding, which will damage rice grow-\ning areas and other properties (Hanh and Furukawa, 2007;\nFig.6).Rising sea levels coupled with accelerated coastal subsi-\ndence caused by excessive groundwater extraction will cause\nlarge portions of the low-lying RRD and MRD to be inun-\ndated and ﬂooded (Allison et al., 2017).This facilitates the\ninﬁltration of saltwater into groundwater aquifers, and this\nmay increase salinity gradients in the MRD and RRD.In par-\nticular, salinity intrusion will worsen during the dry season.Approximately 1.8 million ha in the MRD is already affected\nby dry-season salinity, of which 1.3 million ha is affected by\nsalinity levels above 5 g L−1(Lassa et al., 2016).This area\nis predicted to increase to 2.2 million ha with rising sea lev-\nels.Meanwhile, in the northeastern part of the RRD, the 1 %\nsalinity contour has migrated landwards by 4 to 10 km (Hanh\nand Furukawa, 2007).Increased soil salinization leads to a\nloss of land available for rice production (Fig.6).Though\nthere are already sea dikes and saline water intrusion sluices\nin both the MRD and RRD to reduce incursions of seawater\n(Braun et al., 2018; Tuong et al., 2003), they may be inade-\nquate if they are not well maintained and upgraded.4 Discussion\n4.1 Untangling complexity\nRelevant information on the different drivers and environ-\nmental processes affecting rice production in Vietnam is\nfragmented in a range of academic and non-academic sources\n(Bosch et al., 2007), making it difﬁcult for policymakers and\nmanagers to have a good overview of the reinforcing and\ninterdependent processes and issues affecting food security\nin Vietnam.Using a systems-thinking approach, we amalga-\nmated the various drivers and created ﬂow diagrams to con-\nsider how rice productivity can be positively or negatively\nimpacted by the various drivers and environmental processes\n(Figs.4 and 6).Rice growing areas are negatively affected by\nthe expansion of aquaculture and alternative crops and urban\nexpansion.But with agricultural intensiﬁcation facilitated by\nNat.Hazards Earth Syst.Sci., 21, 1473–1493, 2021 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1473-2021', 'Hens, L., Thinh, N.

Based on the provided context, how has the transformation of agriculture and rural life downstream of Hanoi impacted rice farming in the Mekong Delta?	The transformation of agriculture and rural life downstream of Hanoi has significantly impacted rice farming in the Mekong Delta. The shift towards non-rice crops, aquaculture, and orchards has been driven by higher prices and rising demand for these products, as well as environmental threats such as saltwater intrusion that have limited rice production areas. Many farmers have been forced to convert their rice fields into shrimp ponds or grow salt-tolerant crops like coconut, mango, and sugar cane. Urban expansion is another factor that has reduced rice growing areas. Rapid urbanization has led to the loss of agricultural land, with a significant amount of this land-use conversion occurring in peri-urban areas. This has resulted in a decline in rice growing areas. However, agricultural intensification has allowed rice production to increase despite the shrinking growing areas. Government policies encouraging farmers to move away from growing rice have also contributed to these changes. Despite these shifts, many farmers continue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops. Furthermore, the construction of high dikes to mitigate flooding has facilitated triple-cropping of rice and increased yields. However, these dikes reduce the availability of fertile silt, forcing farmers to rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields. Overall, the transformation of agriculture and rural life downstream of Hanoi has led to a complex interplay of factors that have significantly impacted rice farming in the Mekong Delta.	['1474 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nproblems present in the two deltas in Vietnam and the im-\nplications of these anthropogenic and natural-hazard drivers\non rice agriculture.Although a variety of crops are culti-\nvated in Vietnam, we focus on rice as it is a staple food for\nthe Vietnamese (M. T. Nguyen et al., 2019; USDA, 2012),\nand it is also a key export crop.In 2019, Vietnam exported\nUSD 1.4 billion of rice and was the fourth-largest rice ex-\nporter in the world, contributing 6.6 % of the world’s total\nrice exports (Workman, 2020).Many studies have investigated how Vietnam is af-\nfected by natural hazards or anthropogenic land-use change\n(cf.Howie, 2005; Minderhoud et al., 2018; K.-A.Nguyen et\nal., 2019; Vinh et al., 2014).Several studies go a step further\nto examine how changes in anthropogenic land use have af-\nfected rice productivity.For example, higher prices and rising\ndemand for aquaculture and non-rice products have incen-\ntivized farmers to shift away from rice monoculture to em-\nbrace non-rice crops (Hai, 2021; Morton, 2020).In addition,\nenvironmental threats such as worsening saltwater intrusion\nhave limited rice production areas and forced many farmers\nto convert their now-unusable rice ﬁelds into shrimp ponds\n(Kotera et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2017) or turn to growing\nsalt-tolerant crops such as coconut, mango and sugar cane\n(Nguyen and V o, 2017).Urban expansion is also another key\nfactor that has reduced rice growing areas although agricul-\ntural intensiﬁcation has kept rice yields high despite shrink-\ning growing areas (Drebold, 2017; Morton, 2020).Meanwhile, the construction of high dikes to mitigate\nﬂooding in the Mekong River Delta has facilitated triple-\ncropping of rice and increased yields.However, these high\ndikes reduce the availability of fertile silt and force farmers\nto rely on costly agrochemicals to maintain yields (Chapman\nand Darby, 2016; Tran and Weger, 2018).Though there is\nsubstantial research on sand mining and upstream dam con-\nstruction, these non-related anthropogenic factors are often\nnot linked to agricultural productivity even though reduced\nsediment availability and increased channel erosion would\nhave adverse implications on agricultural productivity (Binh\net al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Jordan et al., 2019).Besides land-use change, rice grown in the RRD and MRD\nis susceptible to damage from natural hazards such as ty-\nphoons, ﬂoods and droughts (Chan et al., 2012, 2015; Gros-\njean et al., 2016; Terry et al., 2012).Rice crops can be dam-\naged by strong winds and ﬂooding from heavy rain associ-\nated with a typhoon event.Rice damage is worse if the ty-\nphoon occurs during the vulnerable heading or harvesting pe-\nriods (Masutomi et al., 2012).In addition, ﬂoods can also be\ncaused by heavy monsoonal rains.Notably, moderate levels\nof freshwater ﬂooding may be beneﬁcial to agricultural pro-\nduction (Chapman et al., 2016).On the other hand, droughts,\nwhile uncommon, have caused millions in economic loss,\nparticularly in the agriculture sector (Grosjean et al., 2016).The most recent 2015–2016 drought affected all the Mekong\nRiver Delta provinces and caused up to USD 360 millionin damage, of which USD 300 million was agriculture- and\naquaculture-related damage (Nguyen, 2017).Arias et al.(2019) conceptually integrated local and re-\ngional drivers of change to illustrate the factors contribut-\ning to environmental change in the Mekong ﬂoodplains.Similarly, M. T. Nguyen et al.(2019) recognized that there\nare various drivers of change associated with adapting to\nwidespread salinity intrusion in the Mekong and Red River\ndeltas, and these drivers are constantly interacting with and\nproviding feedback to each other.', '1478 K. W. Yuen et al.: Interacting effects of land-use change and natural hazards on rice agriculture\nFigure 4. Flow diagram showing the key anthropogenic drivers that affect rice production in the two mega-deltas of Vietnam. The drivers\nare classiﬁed as a local driver if it occurs in the two mega-deltas. Regional drivers are those that occur farther away from the two mega-deltas\nbut within the Asian region. A plus ( +) sign indicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to increase (decrease). A negative ( −) sign\nindicates that an increase (decrease) in A causes B to decrease (increase). Dashed lines with “ ±” are used when outcomes are unclear. For\nexample, dikes reduce ﬂooding, but poorly maintained or planned dikes increase ﬂooding instead. In addition, dikes may potentially cause\nﬂooding in unprotected areas. Agrochemical use may reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, but the overuse of chemicals can lead to\npesticide resistance, which may increase outbreaks of pests and diseases.\nFinally, government policies encouraging farmers to move\naway from growing rice also contributed to the planting of\nmore non-rice crops on paddy land. As a result, there is\nincreased use of paddy land for non-rice crops, orchards,\nand freshwater and brackish aquaculture (Van Kien et al.,\n2020). Using remote sensing to assess land-use and land-\ncover change in the Mekong River Delta, Liu et al. (2020)\nfound that aquaculture had become the second-largest land-\nuse type, following planted land. This was facilitated by gov-\nernment regulations, salt intrusion and higher proﬁtability\nof aquaculture productions. In any case, even though farm-\ners may have moved on from growing rice, many still con-\ntinue to apply excessive quantities of pesticides on their crops\n(Normile, 2013; Fig. 4).\n3.1.2 Urban expansion\nRapid urbanization is accelerating the loss of agricultural\nland in both the Red River Delta and Mekong River Delta. In\nHanoi, a major city in the Red River Delta, 1420 ha of agri-cultural land was lost per year from 2000–2007, equivalent to\na yearly loss of 3 %. By 2025, up to 450 000 ha of agricultural\nland is expected to be converted to urban land. Most of this\nland-use conversion occurs in peri-urban areas 5–15 km from\nthe city center. The same peri-urban land is often used to\ngrow food, ﬂowers and livestock for the urban population in\nHanoi. However, this land is considered by local authorities\nto be land reserve for urban planning instead of resources for\nfood supply (Drebold, 2017; Pham et al., 2015). Most of this\nperi-urban agricultural land is often forcibly obtained, with\nminimal compensation given to farmers, and then sold to for-\neign developers (Drebold, 2017). Similar urban expansion is\nalso occurring in Can Tho city in the Mekong River Delta,\nwith corresponding losses of agricultural land (cf. Garscha-\ngen et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2010). A decline in agricultural\nland means a decline in rice growing areas as well (Fig. 4).\nHigh land prices and a shrinking availability of arable land\nhave forced farmers to practice agricultural intensiﬁcation. In\nthe RRD, rice production grew more than 25 % from 2000–\n2011 without corresponding increases in rice growing areas\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

While the existing literature pre dominantly points the cause of drought to the hydro-\npower dams in the upstream of the Mekong Basin , we contribute new physical evidence of the\nintensi ﬁcation of saline water intrusion (through backwater effect) in the VMD caused by three anthropo-\ngenic drivers: riverbed incision (due to both riverbed m ining and dam construction), sea level rise and land\nsubsidence. Thereupon, we highlight that it is critical to not underestimate the impacts from the localized\nfactors, especially the riverbed-mining which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the\nsalinity intrusion. Our analysis is based on the extensive sets of hourly-to-daily hydrological time series\nfrom 11 gauge stations across the VMD. First, several signs of signi ﬁcantly increased tidal ampliﬁ cation\n(up to 66%) were revealed through the spectral analysi s of the hourly water level data. This trend was fur-\nther validated through the c hanges in slopes of the rating curves at t he tidal zones, implying the relation-\nships between the shift of the backwater effects on the rivers in VMD and the lowered water levelsScience of the Total Environment 757 (2021) 143919\n⁎Corresponding author.\n⁎⁎Correspondence to: E.

What are the main environmental threats to the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, and how does the intrusion of saline water affect the agricultural production and freshwater supply in the region?	The Vietnamese Mekong Delta faces several environmental threats, including the impact of upstream hydropower dams, climate change, and sea level rise. These factors can significantly alter the hydrodynamics of the region. Additionally, the area is also affected by groundwater extraction, which can lead to land subsidence and further increase the vulnerability to sea-level rise. The intrusion of saline water into the Mekong Delta is a significant concern as it directly impacts the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping. Salinity intrusion is sensitive to sea level rise and changes in river flow, and it can reduce the freshwater supply, thereby affecting agricultural production. Furthermore, the willingness of farm households to pay for salinity intrusion risk reduction indicates the severity of this issue.

What are the four identified causes of the recent increase in saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how does riverbed sand mining contribute to this issue?	The four identified causes of the recent increase in saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta are upstream dam construction, sea level rise, land subsidence, and riverbed mining. Riverbed mining contributes to this issue by causing riverbed incision, which alters the balance between fresh and saline water in the delta. This process is likely underestimated due to the generalization of incision rates across the delta using values from local-scale surveys and the crude characterization of bathymetry. The incision rates from riverbed mining are considered to be the highest among the four causes, making it a significant factor in the intensification of saline water intrusion.	"[""exclusively associated with the reach of the Mekong with the highest\nriverbed mining risks, i.e.Tan Chau to My Thuan.Accordingly, we spec-\nulated that the IR caused from dams would also vary, ranging from\n15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020b ).For SLR and LS, we refer to the previously published results, respectivelyreporting the IRs of 1.5 –2 cm/year and 0.82 cm/year ( Eslami et al., 2019 ;\nMinderhoud et al., 2017 ).Among the estimated IRs, we consider that\nthe riverbed mining is the most likely to be underestimated.This isdue to the generalization of the IR across the VMD using the values\ndriven from local-scale survey, and the crude characterization of ba-\nthymetry in the VMD, which is based on extrapolation of the single\nbeam echosounder ( Binh et al., 2020b ).Admittedly, advanced bathym-\netry survey methods such as multibeam echosounder (MBES) mighthave resulted in more accurate estimations of riverbend incision rates.However, covering the world's third largest delta using MBES would\nnot be feasible in terms of time and cost.Plus, given the absence of\nother viable alternatives, what we propose here could lay an important\ngroundwork that can inspire following up research for improvements\nfrom the relevant scienti ﬁc community.The resulting IRs, estimation\nmethods, and the key references are summarized in Table 3 .4.2.Policy outlooks - the need for both integrated and adaptive approaches\n4.2.1.Evidence-based priority of countermeasures\nAccording to our initial assessment on IRs presented in Table 3 ,t h e\nupstream dams have the most signi ﬁcant impact, followed by the river-\nbed mining, SLR and LS, constituting an evidence-based priority for\ndealing with the SI intensifying drivers.However, the major discrepan-\ncies in politics, philosophies and economic interests among the coun-\ntries sharing the Mekong River water resources ( Kansal et al., 2019 )\nwould make negotiating over the hydropower dams with the upstreamcountries an uphill battle for the Vietnam government.In contrast, the\nthree domestic issues should be more immediately manageable with\nregulatory and enforcement measures at different administration levels.Accordingly, with a speci ﬁc consideration of the three domestic pres-\nsures contributing to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, riverbed mining has the\nhighest IRs and substantially higher than those of SLR and LS.It is there-\nfore underlined that mitigating the intrusion of saline water in the VMD\nshould ﬁrst work on strategies to slow down the IR contributing from\nriverbed mining by controlling the sediment excavation volumes.Thiscall for bold, nation-wide actions to decisively control the exports of\nthe riverbed sediments while raising the disciplinary actions against il-\nlegal mining to effectively halt the sinking rate of the delta and safe-\nguard the livelihood of millions of inhabitants.4.2.2.Encouraging eco-based livelihoods for better adaptations\nLivelihood adaptation to salinity intrusion is another key aspect for\npolicy reforms.Our study has indicated how the saline water protrudes\nfurther inland and on a more frequent basis.Other studies have already\nshown how SI and other environmental pressures put millions of inhab-\nitants at critical risks ( Park et al., 2020a ;Park et al., 2020b ;Tamura et al.,\n2020 ;Loc et al., 2020a, 2020b ;Pham et al., 2020 ).Active adaptation to\nsalinity intrusion and living with salinity has also been put on the policy\nagenda with the Mekong Delta Plan (2013) , Resolution 120 in 2017.Moreover, agricultural models are increasingly adopted that thrive onsalinity intrusion.Basically, there are two options.Either farmersadapt their cropping to the wet-dry seasonality and grow a brackish\ncrop during the dry season ( Loc et al., 2017, 2018, 2020a, 2020b ;Tan\net al., 2020 ;Pham et al., 2020 ).The rice-shrimp system is well adapted\nto the regular rain-dry season spell, where a decent crop of rice can be\nharvested during the wet season, followed by the raising of an extensivecrop\nof shrimp."", ""Sea level rise\nDam constructioncaused by the riverbed incision.Finally, we introduc e a novel approach using the annual incision rates of the\nriverbed to compare four SI driving factors in terms of t heir relative contributions to the balance between\nfresh and saline water in the VMD.©2 0 2 0E l s e v i e rB .V .A l lr i g h t sr e s e r v e d .1.Introduction\nThe Mekong River originates from the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau, runs\nacross China and ﬁve other countries, and forms the Vietnamese Me-\nkong Delta (VMD) at the downstream course before draining into the\nEast Sea.With a total area of more than 4 million ha, VMD houses 17\nmillion people and accounts for half of the country's food supplies.With the current productivity of ~25 million tons of rice every year,\nVMD not only safeguards the country's food security but also contrib-\nutes about 18.7% of the national GDP through agricultural products ex-\nports ( Dung et al., 2019 ;Eslami et al., 2019 ;GSO, 2016 ;Piesse, 2019 ).The sustainable development of this important food basket, however,is under several internal and external environmental pressures (e.g.Arias et al., 2019 ;Trung and Thanh, 2013 ;Triet et al., 2017 ).Upstream,\nthere is the looming threat from the accelerated construction of hydro-power dams which have drastically modiﬁ ed the hydro-sedimentary\nregimes of the river (e.g.Anthony et al., 2015 ;Dinh et al., 2012 ;\nEslami et al., 2019 ;Van et al., 2012 ;Yang et al., 2019 ).Operation of\nthese dam reservoirs, combined with the downstream sea level rise(SLR) has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's\nshorelines ( Li et al., 2017 ).Internally in VMD, Park et al.(2020a) re-\nported on the constant decrease of ﬂood frequency over the past two\ndecades due to sand mining and dike construction in both the wet and\ndry seasons (1995 –2015).Several authors, including Brunier et al.(2014) ;Hackney et al.(2020) ;a n d Binh et al.(2020b) have also re-\nported signi ﬁcant geomorphic impacts due to extensive mining in the\nlower reach of the river such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank ero-\nsion.Likewise, due to the groundwater extraction, VMD is currently\nexperiencing land subsidence (LS) at an alarming rate; in the worst-\ncase scenario, this can be as much as a meter by 2050 ( Erban et al.,\n2014 ).Within the long list of environmental perils that VMD is facing, the\nintrusion of saline water is the main threat towards agriculturalproduction as it salinizes the essential freshwater resources, while\nsimultaneously degrading the soil on its penetration path.Annually, ap-\nproximately 2 million ha of agricultural land are prone to the risks of sa-\nlinity intrusion (SI) ( Smajgl et al., 2015 ;Toan, 2014 ).In addition, the\nintrusion of saline water can disrupt the supply of freshwater for bothdomestic (e.g.household daily use) and industrial consumers, especially\nin the coastal areas.Carew-Reid (2008) remarked that during dry sea-\nsons, strong northwestward winds combined with ﬂood tides and sea\nwater, can penetrate anywhere inland between 40 and 60 km from\nthe estuaries on both east and west coasts of the delta.While these\nnumbers seem signi ﬁcant, they pale in comparison to observations\nfrom the 2016 drought, which is the most severe event over the past90 years ( Kantoush et al., 2017 ).The event affected 12 out of 13 prov-\ninces in VMD (>2 million ha in area); of which were forced to declarea\nstate of natural disaster ( Toan, 2017 ).The total economic loss was es-\ntimated to be around 650 million USD, including 800,000 tons of ricecompletely lost.In addition, the lives of 17 million VMD inhabitants\nwere adversely affected.In 2020, the VMD experienced yet another cat-\nastrophic drought which possibly surpasses any historical records, in-\ncluding the ones observed in 2016 (From the local news: https://vtv.vn).""]"

"[""Sea level rise\nDam constructioncaused by the riverbed incision.Finally, we introduc e a novel approach using the annual incision rates of the\nriverbed to compare four SI driving factors in terms of t heir relative contributions to the balance between\nfresh and saline water in the VMD.©2 0 2 0E l s e v i e rB .V .A l lr i g h t sr e s e r v e d .1.Introduction\nThe Mekong River originates from the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau, runs\nacross China and ﬁve other countries, and forms the Vietnamese Me-\nkong Delta (VMD) at the downstream course before draining into the\nEast Sea.With a total area of more than 4 million ha, VMD houses 17\nmillion people and accounts for half of the country's food supplies.With the current productivity of ~25 million tons of rice every year,\nVMD not only safeguards the country's food security but also contrib-\nutes about 18.7% of the national GDP through agricultural products ex-\nports ( Dung et al., 2019 ;Eslami et al., 2019 ;GSO, 2016 ;Piesse, 2019 ).The sustainable development of this important food basket, however,is under several internal and external environmental pressures (e.g.Arias et al., 2019 ;Trung and Thanh, 2013 ;Triet et al., 2017 ).Upstream,\nthere is the looming threat from the accelerated construction of hydro-power dams which have drastically modiﬁ ed the hydro-sedimentary\nregimes of the river (e.g.Anthony et al., 2015 ;Dinh et al., 2012 ;\nEslami et al., 2019 ;Van et al., 2012 ;Yang et al., 2019 ).Operation of\nthese dam reservoirs, combined with the downstream sea level rise(SLR) has resulted in the retreat of approximately 70% of the Delta's\nshorelines ( Li et al., 2017 ).Internally in VMD, Park et al.(2020a) re-\nported on the constant decrease of ﬂood frequency over the past two\ndecades due to sand mining and dike construction in both the wet and\ndry seasons (1995 –2015).Several authors, including Brunier et al.(2014) ;Hackney et al.(2020) ;a n d Binh et al.(2020b) have also re-\nported signi ﬁcant geomorphic impacts due to extensive mining in the\nlower reach of the river such as dramatic riverbed incision and bank ero-\nsion.Likewise, due to the groundwater extraction, VMD is currently\nexperiencing land subsidence (LS) at an alarming rate; in the worst-\ncase scenario, this can be as much as a meter by 2050 ( Erban et al.,\n2014 ).Within the long list of environmental perils that VMD is facing, the\nintrusion of saline water is the main threat towards agriculturalproduction as it salinizes the essential freshwater resources, while\nsimultaneously degrading the soil on its penetration path.Annually, ap-\nproximately 2 million ha of agricultural land are prone to the risks of sa-\nlinity intrusion (SI) ( Smajgl et al., 2015 ;Toan, 2014 ).In addition, the\nintrusion of saline water can disrupt the supply of freshwater for bothdomestic (e.g.household daily use) and industrial consumers, especially\nin the coastal areas.Carew-Reid (2008) remarked that during dry sea-\nsons, strong northwestward winds combined with ﬂood tides and sea\nwater, can penetrate anywhere inland between 40 and 60 km from\nthe estuaries on both east and west coasts of the delta.While these\nnumbers seem signi ﬁcant, they pale in comparison to observations\nfrom the 2016 drought, which is the most severe event over the past90 years ( Kantoush et al., 2017 ).The event affected 12 out of 13 prov-\ninces in VMD (>2 million ha in area); of which were forced to declarea\nstate of natural disaster ( Toan, 2017 ).The total economic loss was es-\ntimated to be around 650 million USD, including 800,000 tons of ricecompletely lost.In addition, the lives of 17 million VMD inhabitants\nwere adversely affected.In 2020, the VMD experienced yet another cat-\nastrophic drought which possibly surpasses any historical records, in-\ncluding the ones observed in 2016 (From the local news: https://vtv.vn)."", 'Climate change impact on ﬂood hazard,\nvulnerability and risk of the Long Xuyen Quadrangle in the Mekong Delta.Interna-tional journal of river basin management 10, 103 –120.Dung, T.D., van Halsema, G., Hellegers, P.J., Hoang, L.P., Ludwig, F., 2019.Long-term sus-\ntainability of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in question: an economic assessment of\nwater management alternatives.Agric.Water Manag.223, 105703.Erban, L.E., Gorelick, S.M., Zebker, H.A., 2014.Groundwater extraction, land subsidence,\nand sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam.Environ.Res.Lett.9, 084010.Eslami, S., Hoekstra, P., Trung, N.N., Kantoush, S.A., Binh, D.V., Dung, D.D., Quang, T.T., Vegt,\nM.V.D., 2019.Tidal ampli ﬁcation and salt intrusion in the Mekong Delta driven by an-\nthropogenic sediment starvation.Sci.Rep. 9, 18746.GSO - Governmental Statistics Of ﬁce, 2016.National Socioeconomic Development Report,\n2016. https://www.gso.gov.vn/default.aspx?tabid=621ItemID=16067 (accessed in\n2020, Hanoi).Ha, D.T., Ouillon, S., Vinh, G.V., 2018.Water and suspended sediment budgets in the lower\nMekong from high-frequency measurements (2009 –2016).Water 10, 846.Hackney, C.R., Darby, S.E., Parsons, D.R., Leyland, J., Best, J.L., Aalto, R., ...

"What is the report ""Intensifying saline water intrusion and drought in Mekong Delta Vietnam"" about?"	"The report ""Intensifying saline water intrusion and drought in Mekong Delta Vietnam"" assesses the recent increase in saline water intrusion and drought in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. It provides new physical evidence of the intensification of saline water intrusion caused by three anthropogenic drivers: riverbed incision (due to both riverbed mining and dam construction), sea level rise, and land subsidence. The report emphasizes the importance of not underestimating the impacts from localized factors, particularly riverbed-mining, which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the salinity intrusion. The analysis is based on extensive sets of hourly-to-daily hydrological time series from 11 gauge stations across the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The report also recommends political reform based on these new findings."

Based on the report, how has the increase in dams in the Mekong basin affected the dry season water level in the Mekong Delta?	The increase in dams in the Mekong basin has not been able to maintain the water level in the Mekong Delta during the dry season. Despite a 33% increase in dry season discharge at Kratie from 2009 to 2015, when 64 dams were completed, the water level in the Mekong Delta during the dry season is still expected to continue decreasing. This is due to factors such as reservoir sediment trapping and sand mining, which cause riverbeds to be continuously incised, making it difficult to maintain the water level.	"[""Mekong River will need to increase by more than 50% by dams' water\nrelease to maintain the water level unchanged. While riverbeds are con-\ntinuously incised due to reservoir sediment trapping and sand mining(Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020a ), that high level of discharge re-\nlease from upstream dams is not always possible. In fact, Binh et al.\n(2020c) found that the mean dry season discharge (i.e. in January –May) at Kratie increased by only 33% in 2009 –2015 (when 64 dams\nwere completed in the Mekong basin) from the pre-dam period(1980 –1992). Consequently, the dry season water level in the VMD is\nexpected to continue decreasing. Fig. 1 B shows signi ﬁcant riverbed inci-\nsion along the entire Tien and Hau River from 1998 to 2008, averaged bytwo to three meters. Binh et al. (2020a) found that the annual river bed\nFig. 1.

What are the combined effects that have led to the increasing trends of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam since the 1990s?	The intensification of saline water intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta has been caused by a combination of factors. These include riverbed incision, which is due to both riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence. The riverbed mining, in particular, can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year, thereby amplifying the salinity intrusion. Additionally, there are signs of significantly increased tidal amplification, which is further validated by changes in slopes of the rating curves at the tidal zones. This implies a relationship between the shift of the backwater effects on the rivers in the Mekong Delta and the lowered water levels.

Based on the report, how has the increase in sand mining activities around My Thuan station affected the intensity of tidal signals and water levels in the Tien river?	The increase in sand mining activities around My Thuan station has led to a significant intensification of tidal signals and a decrease in water levels in the Tien river. The sand mining rate around My Thuan station was much higher, at 8 million tons per year, compared to other areas. This has resulted in greater drops in the water levels of the Tien river, leading to stronger bed water elevation (BWE) and an intensification of tidal signals. In fact, the 12-hour frequency tidal amplitude at My Thuan had increased by 66%, which is substantially higher than the increase observed at coastal areas. This suggests that the effects of sand mining have had a significant impact on the hydrological dynamics of the Tien river.	"[""incision volume in 2014 –2017 from Tan Chau to My Thuan in the Tien\nRiver (52.5 Mm3/year) was nearly three times greater than that in\n1998 –2008 in the entire Tien and Hau Rivers (20 Mm3/year). They\nclaimed that the increased riverbed incision was caused by upstream\ndams (85%) and sand mining (15%). The increasing riverbed incision be-\ntween 1998 and 2008 and 2014 –2017 periods were consistent with the\nrapidly decreased water level at Tan Chau and Chau Doc in post-2011\ncompared to pre-2011 ( Fig. 2 A–B). Additionally, increasing riverbank\nerosion ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Jordan et al., 2019 ) may contribute to\nwater level reduction at riverine stations because of the expansion of\nthe cross-sectional area.\nOn the other hand, the mean annual water levels (calculated from\nthe hourly water level data) at three tidal stations along the coastline:\nBen Trai, My Thanh, and Binh Dai all presented signi ﬁcant increasing\ntrends since the 1990s ( p-value < 0.001) ( Fig. 2 D–F). In particular, the\nmean annual water levels at Ben Trai, My Thanh, and Binh Dai had re-\nspectively increased by approximately 0.072, 0,22 and 0.25 m during\nthe 20-year period from 1990 to 2010. This directly shows the amplify-\ning trend of SLR around VMD which is in line with the ﬁnding by Nhan\n(2016) . The increasing trends of SI across VMD are therefore attributed\nto the combined effects of decreased riverine water levels and increased\ntidal effects. In the following subsections, we further investigate how\nﬂuvial and tidal regimes have shifted in recent decades by analyzing\nthe power spectrum of the water level series.3.2. Ampli ﬁcation of tidal signals\n3.2.1. Power spectral analysis of the tidal effects\nThe estuaries of the Tien and Hau rivers are dominated by semi-\ndiurnal tides which have two troughs and two peaks daily (12- and24-hour oscillations in Fig. 3 A–F). On a monthly basis, the spring tide\nand neap tide, each occurs twice a month (half-month and one-month\noscillations in Fig. 3 A–F). Under pristine condition, these temporal fre-\nquencies and the respective amplitudes of the tidal regime should stayalmost unchanged. However, the results from our power spectral anal-\nysis show otherwise. More speci ﬁcally, the amplitudes of almost every\nspectral peak of the monthly tidal cycles had increased signi ﬁcantly\nafter 2000 periods at all river stations in our analysis ( Fig. 3 G–H). We\nspeculate that these unusual increases of the spectral peaks couldhave been attributed to the following: the increased tidal amplitude\n(in the continental shelf due to SLR) ( Nhan, 2016 ), drops in water levels\n(related to the riverbed mining and upstream dams) ( Park et al., 2020a ;\nPark et al., 2020b ), and LS ( Erban et al., 2014 ;Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).\nTable 2 further quanti ﬁes the shifts in the power spectral peaks at all\nthree analyzed stations. More speci ﬁcally, the power spectral density of\ntheﬂuvial oscillation (1 year monsoonal-seasonality) has decreased the\nmost at Hoa Binh (from 3.8 dB to −10.6 dB), followed by My Thuan\n(from−11\ndB to −12.5 dB) and Dai Ngai (from −11.1 dB to\n−11.6 dB).

Based on the context, how has the frequency of saline water intrusion in My Thuan, Hoa Binh, and Dai Ngai changed before and after 2000?	In My Thuan, the frequency of saline water intrusion has increased for 12-hour and half-month periods, and for 1-month periods after 2000 compared to before 2000.

How has the intensification of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta been influenced by changes in riverbed incision and tidal velocity?	The intensification of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta has been influenced by changes in riverbed incision and tidal velocity in several ways. Riverbed incision, caused by both riverbed mining and dam construction, has been identified as a major driver of saline water intrusion. This process can deepen the channel by up to 15 cm/year, which amplifies the intrusion of saline water. Additionally, the study found that the volume of riverbed incision from 2014 to 2017 was nearly three times greater than that from 1998 to 2008, which has contributed to a decrease in water levels.On the other hand, tidal velocity has also played a significant role. The study revealed signs of significantly increased tidal amplification, up to 66%, through the spectral analysis of the hourly water level data. This trend was further validated through changes in the slopes of the rating curves at the tidal zones, implying a relationship between the shift of the backwater effects on the rivers in the Mekong Delta and the lowered water levels. The increasing trends of saline water intrusion across the Mekong Delta are therefore attributed to the combined effects of decreased riverine water levels and increased tidal effects.

Based on the report, how much is the salinity concentration expected to increase in places 30 km from the sea if there is a discharge reduction combined with a sea level rise?	The salinity concentration in places 30 km from the sea is expected to increase by 14–23% if the discharge decreases by 364 m³/s. If this discharge reduction combines with a sea level rise of 3.36 cm, the increase in salinity concentration could be between 35–51%.	"[""In this regard, reductions in the discharge of the Mekong River and cli-\nmate change-induced SLR are attributed as major causes of SI increment\nin the VMD ( Khang et al., 2008 ;Mai et al., 2018a, 2018b ;Toan, 2014 ;Vu\net al., 2018 ).Comparing to the baseline in 2000, if sea level rises by\n25–30 cm in 2050, SI length and salinity concentration will increase\nby 10 km and 0.5 –2.5 g/l in places 15 km from the sea ( Vu et al.,\n2018 ).Khong et al.(2018) estimated that the salinity isoline of 2.5 g/l\nis likely to intrude further up-river by 10 km in the main rivers and by20 km in the paddy ﬁeld if there is a combined effect of 20 cm SLR\nand 15% discharge reduction of the Mekong River in the mid-2030s.The respective numbers would be 20 km and 35 km if SLR of 45 cm com-\nbines with 29% discharge reduction of the Mekong River in the mid-2090s.Toan (2014) estimated that saline water will intrude further\nup-river by 20 km and 27 km in the Tien and Hau Rivers, respectively,if sea level rises by 1 m. In a different manner, Mai et al.(2018a) exam-\nined what would happen if there was no emergency water release fromdams in the 2015 –2016 drought event.They revealed that salinity con-\ncentration in places 30 km from the sea will increase by 14 –23% if the\ndischarge entering the VMD decreases by 364 m\n3/s from March 27 to\nApril 27, 2016.The value will be 35 –51% if such discharge reduction\ncombines with a 3.36 cm SLR.In this combined scenario, the SI lengthmay increase by 16 –24 km in the mainstream.Another important driver\nof the recently enhanced SI in the VMD is the increasing construction ofhydraulic structures in the estuaries (i.e.salinity control sluice gates\nalong the main rivers).Surprisingly, the purpose of these hydraulic\nstructures is to control SI but Binh et al.(2020c) numerically found\nthat the construction of salinity control sluice gates along Tien andHau Rivers may enhance the length of SI up-river because of reducing\nbuffering zones near the estuaries.4.Management outlooks and policy implications\n4.1.The need to decouple the contributing factors to the SI: a budgetary\napproach\nThe results presented above have clari ﬁed how the dynamics of\nwater level balance between river and coastal can control the level ofSI in the VMD.The tug of war between salt and freshwater is deter-\nmined by a combined effect of riverbed mining, upstream hydropower\ndams, SLR, and LS.These drivers are recognized at different geographical\nscales; likewise, their respective countermeasures.For instance, while\nriverbed mining or LS can be entirely managed domestically, the opera-\ntion of the upstream dams can only be negotiated via transnational dip-\nlomatic measures.It is therefore critical to understand the roles of each\ndriver to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, hence effectively prioritizing the coun-\ntermeasures.In addition, the limited ﬁnancial and technical resources of\na developing country such as Vietnam critically urge the need to rankthe relative importance of the drivers to plan the mitigation strategies\naccordingly.In fact, a synthesized appreciation of the Mekong River\nbasin from the geomorphology and sedimentary perspectives, such as\nin the neighboring Chao Phraya basin (e.g.Park et al., 2020b ) is impor-\ntant, yet essentially lacking.Besides, the current understanding of SI in the VMD has been the-\nmatically fragmented so far, including for instance, tidal ampli ﬁcations\n(Eslami et al., 2019 ), riverbed mining and bank erosion ( Hackney\net al., 2020 ), or LS ( Minderhoud et al., 2017, 2018 ).The imbalance\ncould have been related to each research teams' technical backgrounds\nand expertise but mainly due to the challenge to separate the com-\npound effects on SI from different pressures."", 'The preliminary assessment has shown that the SI, with a salinity\nrate (i.e.salt concentration) of 4 g/L, has entered 50 –130 km deep into\nthe main rivers since February in 2020, a substantial increase comparedto the same period in 2016 ( United Nations, 2020 ).In the last 30 years,\nthe interval between the drought events has decreased by at least2 years: 1992, 1998, 2005, 2010, 2016, and 2020; the close occurrenceof the last two historical events constitutes the gravest warning signs re-\ngarding the ever-increasing severity of SI.In principle, SI is the outcome of the competition between upstream\nﬂuvial discharges and downstream tidal mixing forces ( Pritchard, 1952 ;\nSavenije, 2012 ).However, this might not be entirely true in the case of\nthe VMD, whereby the discharge upstream at Kratie station in\nCambodia has not shown a signi ﬁcant trend in the last 20 years, even\nduring the dry period ( Park et al., 2020b ).Given the stationary dis-\ncharge trend into the VMD, we argue that the dynamics of water level\nbetween the river and the sea is the main control of SI, by continuously\nchanging the intensity of the backwater effects (BWE).Naturally, stron-\nger BWE is imposed on the river when the sea level offshore is relatively\nhigher; the tidal amplication in VMD has risen by 1.5 –2 cm/year from\n1.2–2 mm/year, from offshore to the inland ( Eslami et al., 2019 ).There-\nfore, monitoring water levels in rivers in relation to the tidal gauges, can\nbe used for assessment of the BWE.In the VMD, the four causes of the\nrecent increase in SI have been identi ﬁed by Eslami et al.(2019) and\nMinderhoud et al.(2018) as upstream dams, riverbed mining, SLR and\nLS.Even though the upstream dams are predominantly in the spotlight,\nwe consider the localized riverbed mining activities at least comparable\nregarding the impacts on SI despite having substantially fewer associ-\nated studies.However, Binh et al.(2020a) remarked that while it\nmight take more than a decade to realize the impacts at the VMD\nfrom the upstream dams, sand mining can cause immediately visible\nconsequences, such as a drop of more than 1 m in less than 15 years\n(Park et al., 2020a ).Climate change-induced SLR also contributes to\nthe increased BWE in the VMD.However, the magnitude of impacts ismuch slower (1 –2 cm/year rise) compared to the sand mining in rivers\n(10 –15 cm/year drop along Tien River) ( Erban et al., 2014 ).Even though\nthere is a general understanding that the intensity and extent of the\nsaline water intrusion are largely determined by ﬂuvial (discharges)\nand marine (tidal mixing) processes, the roles of localized factors,such as riverbed mining should not be overlooked.In fact, if left unmon-\nitored, these localized factors can even cause far more tangible impacts\nthan the upstream reservoir construction, in terms of the sediment\nlosses downstream ( Bravard et al., 2013 ).Yet the mining-induced\nmorphodynamics in the VMD is spatially complicated ( Brunier et al.,\n2014 ), hence have only been measured through indirect inferences,\nsuch as the developments of tidal signals.More speci ﬁcally, riverbed in-\ncision increases in-land tidal amplitudes and velocities, both in turn en-\nhance the intrusion of saline water ( Eslami et al., 2019 ).In this paper, we present multiple novel evidence of the impacts\nof riverbed sand mining, upstream hydropower dams, SLR and LS\non\nthe recent intensi ﬁcation of SI in the VMD, focusing on the post-\n2000 period.We employ four different analytical methods, includingtime series trend analysis (Mann-Kendall), Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT) based power spectral analysis, rating curve analysis and nu-\nmerical modeling of saline water intrusion in the VMD.In addition\nto con ﬁrming the ascending trend of SI, this paper clariﬁ es the piv-\notal role of riverbed incision in intensifying the SI related droughtsin the VMD.']"
"""What is the method proposed in the report to estimate the level of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how does it relate to riverbed mining and upstream dams?"""	The report proposes a conceptual approach to estimate the relative contributions to saline intrusion from upstream hydropower dams and riverbed mining. It suggests that the incision rate (IR) caused by dams can vary from 15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year. The report also considers riverbed mining to be a significant factor contributing to saline intrusion, with the IR potentially being underestimated due to the generalization of the IR across the Mekong Delta and the crude characterization of bathymetry. Advanced bathymetry survey methods could provide more accurate estimations, but they are not feasible due to time and cost constraints. Therefore, the report proposes this approach as a groundwork for future research. The report also suggests that mitigating the intrusion of saline water should first focus on strategies to slow down the IR from riverbed mining by controlling sediment excavation volumes.	"[""exclusively associated with the reach of the Mekong with the highest\nriverbed mining risks, i.e.Tan Chau to My Thuan.Accordingly, we spec-\nulated that the IR caused from dams would also vary, ranging from\n15.6 cm/year to 45.6 cm/year ( Brunier et al., 2014 ;Binh et al., 2020b ).For SLR and LS, we refer to the previously published results, respectivelyreporting the IRs of 1.5 –2 cm/year and 0.82 cm/year ( Eslami et al., 2019 ;\nMinderhoud et al., 2017 ).Among the estimated IRs, we consider that\nthe riverbed mining is the most likely to be underestimated.This isdue to the generalization of the IR across the VMD using the values\ndriven from local-scale survey, and the crude characterization of ba-\nthymetry in the VMD, which is based on extrapolation of the single\nbeam echosounder ( Binh et al., 2020b ).Admittedly, advanced bathym-\netry survey methods such as multibeam echosounder (MBES) mighthave resulted in more accurate estimations of riverbend incision rates.However, covering the world's third largest delta using MBES would\nnot be feasible in terms of time and cost.Plus, given the absence of\nother viable alternatives, what we propose here could lay an important\ngroundwork that can inspire following up research for improvements\nfrom the relevant scienti ﬁc community.The resulting IRs, estimation\nmethods, and the key references are summarized in Table 3 .4.2.Policy outlooks - the need for both integrated and adaptive approaches\n4.2.1.Evidence-based priority of countermeasures\nAccording to our initial assessment on IRs presented in Table 3 ,t h e\nupstream dams have the most signi ﬁcant impact, followed by the river-\nbed mining, SLR and LS, constituting an evidence-based priority for\ndealing with the SI intensifying drivers.However, the major discrepan-\ncies in politics, philosophies and economic interests among the coun-\ntries sharing the Mekong River water resources ( Kansal et al., 2019 )\nwould make negotiating over the hydropower dams with the upstreamcountries an uphill battle for the Vietnam government.In contrast, the\nthree domestic issues should be more immediately manageable with\nregulatory and enforcement measures at different administration levels.Accordingly, with a speci ﬁc consideration of the three domestic pres-\nsures contributing to the intensi ﬁcation of SI, riverbed mining has the\nhighest IRs and substantially higher than those of SLR and LS.It is there-\nfore underlined that mitigating the intrusion of saline water in the VMD\nshould ﬁrst work on strategies to slow down the IR contributing from\nriverbed mining by controlling the sediment excavation volumes.Thiscall for bold, nation-wide actions to decisively control the exports of\nthe riverbed sediments while raising the disciplinary actions against il-\nlegal mining to effectively halt the sinking rate of the delta and safe-\nguard the livelihood of millions of inhabitants.4.2.2.Encouraging eco-based livelihoods for better adaptations\nLivelihood adaptation to salinity intrusion is another key aspect for\npolicy reforms.Our study has indicated how the saline water protrudes\nfurther inland and on a more frequent basis.Other studies have already\nshown how SI and other environmental pressures put millions of inhab-\nitants at critical risks ( Park et al., 2020a ;Park et al., 2020b ;Tamura et al.,\n2020 ;Loc et al., 2020a, 2020b ;Pham et al., 2020 ).Active adaptation to\nsalinity intrusion and living with salinity has also been put on the policy\nagenda with the Mekong Delta Plan (2013) , Resolution 120 in 2017.Moreover, agricultural models are increasingly adopted that thrive onsalinity intrusion.Basically, there are two options.Either farmersadapt their cropping to the wet-dry seasonality and grow a brackish\ncrop during the dry season ( Loc et al., 2017, 2018, 2020a, 2020b ;Tan\net al., 2020 ;Pham et al., 2020 ).The rice-shrimp system is well adapted\nto the regular rain-dry season spell, where a decent crop of rice can be\nharvested during the wet season, followed by the raising of an extensivecrop\nof shrimp."", 'Therefore, this scope of this paper expands into intro-\nducing a conceptual approach to estimate the relative contributions\nto SI from upstream hydropower dams and riverbed mining.Finally,\nbased on the novel biophysical evidence presented, we recommend\npotential measures for the VMD policy makers to deal with the\never-intensifying intrusion of saline water, incorporating both tech-n i c a la n dp o l i t i c a la s p e c t s .H.H.Loc, D.

What are the main drivers intensifying salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and what strategies are suggested to mitigate these effects?	The main drivers intensifying salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta are riverbed incision, which is due to both riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence. The paper suggests that it is crucial not to underestimate the impacts from these localized factors, especially riverbed-mining, which can incise the channel by up to 15 cm/year and amplify the salinity intrusion. To mitigate these effects, the paper recommends political reform based on the new findings.

What are some alternative crops or farming methods that can be adopted in areas of the Mekong Delta that are exposed to year-round saline water intrusion?	Farmers in areas of the Mekong Delta exposed to year-round saline water intrusion could consider growing short-season vegetable crops that can be cultivated with limited fresh water, such as beans, spinach, and onions. They could also explore salt-tolerant fruticulture, such as coconut and pineapple, or brackish aquaculture supported with water infrastructure. Another promising approach is the ecosystem-based model of mangrove-shrimp farming, which involves community involvement and the cultivation of economically valued species like the black tiger giant shrimp in mangrove forests. This model also encourages farmers to protect the mangrove forests, which in turn provides protection from storm surges.	['Instead of shrimp, farmers could grow a short-season\nvegetable crop that can be grown with the limited fresh water available,\nsuch as beans, spinach, and onions.Another option worth exploring is the salt-tolerant fruticulture (e.g.coconut, pineapple) or brackish aquaculture that is supported with\nwater infrastructure (e.g.separate intake-outtake channels, daily\nrefreshing, use of bio ﬁlters, no groundwater pumping).This is particu-\nlarly important for those areas with year-round exposure to salinewater.Finally, an ecosystem-based model that has shown various\npromising merits while being adopted to the SI prone coastal areas is\nthe mangrove-shrimp ( Nguyen et al., 2020a ).This ecosystem-based\nmodel was built upon the community involvement whereby thefarmers are supported both in terms of ﬁnance and technical know-\nhows to cultivate economically valued (the black tiger giant shrimp)in the mangrove forests.Thereupon, the farmers proactively protect\nthe mangrove forests as their own properties, which in turn, safeguards\nanother important ecosystem service being the protection from storm\nsurges.4.2.3.Transboundary water diplomacy\nEven though the upstream dams pose the most challenging barrier\nto the SI that the VMD currently faces, there are potential pathways to\novercome.The key focus is how to effectively negotiate the co-shared\nwater resources with the competing upstream users, those whose ben-\neﬁts are directly/indirectly related to the hydropower dams.Theoreti-\ncally, this can be done via multinational diplomatic platforms namely,\nthe Mekong River Commission (MRC), the Greater Mekong Subregion\n(GMS) Program, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).However, they have not been as productive as intended due to multiple\ndiscrepancies between the member countries in terms of political/eco-\nnomic interests ( Kansal et al., 2019 ).Plus, not all geographically related\ncountries are keen on multilateral dialogues, instead, they opt for bilat-eral diplomacies, making the unanimity in sharing the resources within\nthe Mekong River Basin even harder to achieve ( Kuenzer and Renaud,\n2012 ).Nevertheless, it is strongly emphasized that the issues of the up-\nstream dams should be constantly discussed at regional and interna-\ntional forums so that the negative impacts of these structures on the\nbasin environment, including the intensi ﬁed salinity can be widely ac-\nknowledged.In doing so, the VMD stakeholders can generate supportfrom the international community, essential for the transboundary\nwater diplomacy plan.5.Conclusions\nThis paper advances the current understanding of SI in the VMD,\nhighlighting the signi ﬁcant recent shifts of the BWE imposed on the riv-\ners.This BWE is driven by four main environmental pressures: riverbed\nincision due to riverbed mining and dam construction, SLR and LS.Our\nanalysis is based on the extensive data sets of hydrological time series\nfrom 11 gauge stations across the VMD, along with ﬁeld survey bathym-\netry data.Table 3\nRiverbed incision rates (IRs) from different drivers.Rank Drivers Rate (cm/year) Estimation method References\n1 Upstream dams 15.6 –45.6 IRtotal−IRriverbed mining Brunier et al.(2014)Binh et al.(2020b)\n2 Riverbed mining 4.4 –15 V\nmined / Area water surface Jordan et al.(2019)Erban et al.(2014)\n3 Sea level rise 1.5 –2 Literature Eslami et al.(2019)\n4 Land subsidence 0–0.82 Literature Minderhoud et al.(2017)H.H.Loc, D.

"""What are the main drivers of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how can farmers adapt to this issue?"""	The main drivers of saline water intrusion in the Mekong Delta are riverbed incision due to riverbed mining and dam construction, sea level rise, and land subsidence. To adapt to this issue, farmers could consider growing short-season vegetable crops that can be grown with the limited fresh water available, such as beans, spinach, and onions. They could also explore salt-tolerant fruticulture like coconut and pineapple, or brackish aquaculture supported with water infrastructure. Another adaptation strategy is the ecosystem-based model of mangrove-shrimp farming, which has shown promising results in areas prone to saline water intrusion. This model involves community involvement where farmers are supported financially and technically to cultivate economically valued species like the black tiger giant shrimp in mangrove forests. This not only provides a source of income but also encourages the protection of mangrove forests, which in turn, safeguards against storm surges.

What are the impacts of groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, as discussed in the report?	The report discusses that groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, have significant impacts on the region. These factors contribute to the intensification of saline water intrusion and drought, which can affect agricultural productivity and the livelihoods of the local population. Additionally, these factors can lead to a dramatic decrease in flood frequency due to river-bed mining and dyke construction. The long-term sustainability of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta is also questioned due to these impacts.

What are the potential impacts of upstream hydropower dams and climate change on the hydrodynamics of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, particularly in relation to salinity intrusion and its effects on irrigation water availability for rice cropping?	Upstream hydropower dams and climate change can significantly impact the hydrodynamics of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. These factors can lead to an increase in salinity intrusion, which is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers. This can have a direct impact on the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping. As the salinity of the water increases, it becomes less suitable for irrigation purposes, potentially affecting the productivity of rice crops in the region. Additionally, the operation of dams and sea level rise can further exacerbate saltwater intrusion into the Mekong Delta.

What are the potential impacts of rising sea levels and salinity intrusion on farming systems in the saline region of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Rising sea levels and salinity intrusion can have significant impacts on farming systems in the saline region of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These environmental changes can salinize essential freshwater resources, which are crucial for irrigation and farming. The soil can also be degraded as the saline water penetrates it. Annually, approximately 2 million hectares of agricultural land are at risk of salinity intrusion. This can disrupt the supply of freshwater for both domestic and industrial uses, especially in coastal areas. During severe events, such as the 2016 drought, the intrusion of saline water can lead to significant economic losses, including the loss of large quantities of rice crops. The lives of the inhabitants of the Mekong Delta, many of whom rely on farming for their livelihood, can be adversely affected.

What are the potential impacts of climate change on the propagation of fluvial floods in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta?	The potential impacts of climate change on the propagation of fluvial floods in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta include increased flood hazards, vulnerability, and risk. This is due to factors such as intensified saline water intrusion, drought, and changes in hydrodynamics. Additionally, sea-level rise and changes in river flow can exacerbate salinity intrusion, impacting the availability of irrigation water for rice cropping. The construction of upstream hydropower dams can also affect the hydrodynamics of the delta. Furthermore, climate change can lead to increased sediment starvation, which can drive tidal amplification and further salt intrusion.

What are the potential impacts of groundwater overexploitation, including the risk of seawater intrusion, on the quality of groundwater and human health in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Overexploitation of groundwater in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, can lead to several negative environmental impacts. One of the most prominent is the decrease of hydraulic heads, which increases the potential for seawater intrusion. This intrusion can substantially degrade the quality of groundwater, limiting its use for various purposes. Moreover, the degraded water quality can also negatively impact human health. Another significant impact is severe local land subsidence, which is caused by decreased pore pressure due to excessive pumping. This results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. In combination with other processes, this could threaten the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta.

What are the potential impacts of direct seawater intrusion on the groundwater system in the Ca Mau Peninsula, the southernmost province in Vietnam, and how might it affect the salinization rates in the region?	Direct seawater intrusion into the groundwater system in the Ca Mau Peninsula could lead to a substantial degradation of groundwater quality. This could limit its use and potentially affect human health. The salinization rates in the region could increase due to the intrusion of seawater. Additionally, the overexploitation of groundwater could lead to a decrease in hydraulic heads, further enhancing the potential for seawater intrusion. This could also lead to severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, resulting in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. These combined effects could threaten the very existence of the low-lying areas in the region.

What is the method used to calculate the average thickness of the Miocene aquifer n13 in the study by Bauer et al., 2022?	The average thickness of the Miocene aquifer n13 in the study by Bauer et al., 2022 was calculated by interpolating down to the aquifer from the data available. This was based on the mean layer thickness from the available data.	['Average thickness \ncalculated by interpolating down to the Miocene aquifer n13 (chapter 2.2.4).Each aquifer is overlain by the corresponding aquitard (not included \nhere).Ages after Cohen et al.(2013) .The lower boundary from n13 is estimated after Wagner et al.(2012) .J. Bauer et al.', 'Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n7then stacked (Turner, 2006 ).This approach is common in sedimentary environments and is widely used for groundwater mapping \n(Natali et al., 2012 ).Subsurface modelling was conducted using MATLAB 2020b (MathWorks Inc.).Top and bottom boundaries from \n14 layers recorded in 27 boreholes were used as 3-D scattered input data.While almost all boreholes reach aquifer qp1, except one, the number of boreholes reaching deeper layers are gradually decreasing \nwith only seven reaching aquifer n21 and only one the aquitard beneath.As this is a typical phenomenon in lithological data acquisition \n(Turner, 2006 ), all boreholes were vertically interpolated down to the Miocene aquifer n13 based on mean layer thickness from the \navailable data.No information from outside the study area was used because depth and thickness of stratigraphic units significantly \nvary throughout the delta (Nguyen et al., 2000 ) and might have therefore distorted the calculation.For the model, a 2-D grid was \ncreated with a 100m resolution in latitude and longitude direction using the meshgrid command, and for each layer a 3-D data \ninterpolation was done using triangulation-based natural neighbor method with griddata , which was then visualized using the mesh \ncommand.It should be noted that the quality of the provided borehole logs could not be further evaluated here and thus no extensive \nmodel validation was conducted.Based on the straightforward model approach, the model does not consider discontinues clay lenses \nwithin aquifers (Erban et al., 2013 ) and other potential small-scale characteristics, such as paleo channels as well as areas of \nnon-deposition and areas of erosion (Turner, 2006 ).Groundwater samples were plotted in this subsurface model to enable a sample to aquifer assignment.In order to account for a thin \naquitard between aquifer qp2–3 and qp1 and to account for possible aforementioned uncertainties in the interpolation, it was only \ndistinguished between Pleistocene and Pliocene samples.Samples outside of the convex hull were correlated with the nearest borehole \nand assigned to the respective aquifer.In addition, a 71.5 km long geological cross section was drawn through the model area.Samples, larger cities and monitoring wells within a 10km perpendicular distance to the profile were included.Location of monitoring \nwells and the course of the cross section are displayed in Fig.2.Most monitoring wells accumulate around CMC.Extrapolation outside \nthe convex hull of the available borehole data was avoided intentionally to assure a more valid model within the verifiable boundaries.Therefore, the cross-section was not extrapolated to the sea.3.Results \n3.1.Water geochemistry \nMajor geochemical water parameters are listed in Table 2.EC values range between 571 µS/cm and 5180 µS/cm.21 samples have \nEC between 2500 and 3850 µS/cm while two samples in the northwest have EC around 5000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).A mean conversion factor \nfor EC to TDS of 0.81 was calculated.Note that this factor deviates from 0.67, which is commonly used by NAWAPI.As this conversion \nfactor is highly depended on ionic water composition the conversion factor presented here is more accurate for the study area and \nshould be considered for future water use guidelines.Na+is the dominant cation in the majority of samples in CMP.The Piper Diagram in Fig.4 shows that Na-Cl, Na-HCO 3 and mixed \nwater types occur in Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers.Pliocene samples are depleted in Ca2++Mg2+and contain over 70% Na+, while \nsome Pleistocene samples contain more divalent cations, especially those with high EC and a higher proportion of Cl-.Sulfate only \nplays a minor role in the water composition, is mostly below 10% and never exceeds 25%.The spatial distribution of the detailed water \ntype (see chapter 2.2.2) is presented in Fig.3.In this classification the dominant water type is Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl).Only eleven \nsamples are solely dominated by Cl-.It is striking that these samples of Na-Cl type, shown in red, are randomly distributed in CMP.Two \nsamples in the north of CMP are of Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-(Na)-HCO 3 type, colored in blue.']
Based on the changes in sea levels and sedimentation in the Mekong Delta, how has the distribution of saline and fresh groundwater been affected in the region's aquifers?	"The distribution of saline and fresh groundwater in the Mekong Delta's aquifers has been significantly affected by changes in sea levels and sedimentation. Overexploitation of groundwater has led to a decrease in hydraulic heads, which increases the potential for seawater intrusion. This intrusion can substantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and impact human health. Additionally, local land subsidence, induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, combined with natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, a decline in fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, and salinization of surface water, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. In some parts of the Delta, the consequences of groundwater extraction surpass the impact of sea-level rise. The overall problems can be summarized as a progressive ""loss of land and freshwater"", which could eventually lead to the inundation of large parts of the delta."

Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ;

Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

"""What is the significance of molar ion ratios in distinguishing between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers?"""	Molar ion ratios, such as Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl- and Mg2+/Cl-, are useful tools for distinguishing between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. These ratios can help identify the type of water present and the geochemical processes associated with salinization. For example, a Na+/Cl- molar ratio above the seawater ratio of 0.86 in most samples indicates that freshwater intrusion is or was the predominant process. On the other hand, samples with a ratio below the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of freshening. Therefore, the evaluation of these molar ion ratios, in combination with detailed water type analysis and consideration of cation exchange processes, can identify signs of salinization, even in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.	['However, especially in redox-sensitive \nmarine and coastal settings, the difference between total alkalinity and carbonate alkalinity may not be neglected due to the \nimpact of other buffering bases such as B(OH) 4-, NH3, Si(OH) 3 O-, or F- (Lukawska-Matuszewska, 2016 ).The conversion factor for EC to TDS is highly depended on ionic water composition and may differ from the instrument value, \nwhich is typically calibrated by KCl solution (Vengosh, 2013 ).Therefore, TDS was calculated for each sample using the software \nGeochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC) with the whole elemental composition as input data.Furthermore, the \ndirect relationship between all parameters was calculated using pairwise Spearman correlation.The calcium carbonate system in coastal groundwater settings is complex, and many processes actually lead to carbonate disso -\nlution with subsequent increase in HCO 3- and Ca2+(Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).In saline aquifers, mixing of calcium carbonate \nsaturated fresh groundwater with seawater, which is typically oversaturated, produces brackish water which is undersaturated with \nregard to calcium carbonate due to the reduction in ionic strength, leading to calcite dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987 ).The saturation indices for calcite (SIcalcite) were calculated using Geochemist`s Workbench (v. 12.0, Aqueous Solutions LLC).Furthermore, SI of additional evaporites including aragonite, dolomite, gypsum, sylvite and halite were calculated.The proportion of major cations Na++K+, Ca2+and Mg2+and anions HCO 3-, Cl- and SO42- were calculated and displayed in a Piper \nDiagram (Piper, 1944 ).The water type can be derived from the upper diamond shape (Back and Hanshaw, 1965 ).Water type analysis \ncan help to distinguish geochemical processes and to derive the origin of solutes.However, divisions and percentages used for clas-\nsification should be selected as to best fit the characteristics of the investigated water (Freeze and Cherry, 1979 ).Therefore, to achieve \na more detailed water type specification and to get more insights on mixed water types, the typical description was customized in order \nto more accurately display different states of salinization with an emphasis on cation-exchange processes.Proportions of major ions \nwere calculated and if only one cation or anion was above 33.3%, it is written alone, like Na-Cl water type, while if two ions were above \n33.3%, the ion with the higher proportion was written first, followed by the second ion in brackets, for example Na-Cl-(HCO 3).A mixed \nwater type is thus only defined if all three anions or cations have an equal share of around 33.3%, e.g.Na-Ca-Mg-Cl is written as Mix-Cl.2.2.3.Salinization and freshening \nThe evaluation of molar ion ratios is an appropriate tool to distinguish between seawater and freshwater intrusion in coastal \naquifers (Appelo, 1994; Jones et al., 1999; Russak et al., 2016 ).Therefore, Na+/Cl-, Ca2+/Cl- and Mg2+/Cl- molar ratios were \ncalculated and compared to the conservative mixing line.Generally, salinization of a freshwater aquifer by seawater intrusion proceeds J. Bauer et al.', 'Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n12CMP where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low (Kim et al., 2017; Chapelle and McMahon, 1991 ).Overall, this is an \nimportant finding, demonstrating that the increase of EC values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater \nintrusion, but can also be attributed to the generation of additional HCO 3-.4.2.Salinization and freshening processes \nCoastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion, \nrespectively (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Han et al., 2020 ).Fig.8 reveals that the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the \nstudy area is well above the seawater ratio of 0.86.Only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater.It is remarkable that the water \ntype of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing Cl- concentration from Mix-Cl-(HCO 3) and \nCa-Cl-(HCO 3) over Na-Mg-Cl and finally to Na-Cl, while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) \ntype.This observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and \nfreshening.The customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with \nsalinization.It can be observed that Na-Mg-Cl seem to occur at higher Cl- concentrations compared to Ca-Cl-(HCO 3) (see Fig.8), \nprobably because seawater contains more Mg2+over Ca2+with a Mg2+/Ca2+ratio of 4.5–5.2 (Vengosh, 2013 ).The Mg2+/Cl- ratio is \nshown in Fig.9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest Na+/Cl- ratios and salinization water types, again demonstrating the \ncation-exchange processes.The same pattern can be observed for Ca2+/Cl- (Fig.10) but with a wider spread and deviation from the \nmixing line, as Ca2+concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution, which in turn \ndepend on HCO 3- concentrations.In conclusion, freshwater intrusion is, or was, the predominant process leading to the abundant Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) type \ngroundwater in CMP.The rarely occurring groundwater of Na-Cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, where Cl- is still the dominant anion.Further freshening produces waters of Na-HCO 3 type and Cl- below 25mg/L, as found \nin the northeast of the study area.Due to the general hydrogeological conditions, it can also be assumed that the freshening process has \nprogressed furthest in this region.This assumption is supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- \nbetween 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east (Fig.7).It can be expected that both processes, cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decompo -\nsition, contribute to observed Na-HCO 3 groundwater in CMP.Detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of Na+/ \nCl- molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization, \neven in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.Focusing on total salinity via EC analysis alone, however, is not a suitable method.For \nexample, three samples in the central north (Fig.5c) have EC values below 1000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).However, based on their Na+/Cl- \nratio, which is below the seawater line (Fig.7), and their water type (Fig.3), particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of \nsalinization.4.3.Groundwater evolution and development \nMarine transgression and regression phases in the Quaternary (Fig.']
How does the process of salinization affect the groundwater in the Mekong Delta, specifically in terms of the exchange of cations like Ca2+, Na+, and Mg2+?	During the early stages of salinization, fresh Ca2+-dominated groundwater in the Mekong Delta becomes enriched in Na+ and Mg2+. Divalent cations are generally exchanged on the mineral surface preferentially to monovalent cations. However, as salinization intensifies, this ion selectivity is masked by the proportional increase in sorption with increasing concentration, especially of the monovalent ion Na+. As salinization progresses, Na+ exchanges divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ from sedimentary rocks, forming Ca-Cl and Na-Mg-Cl waters. This process also leads to an overall increase in salinity and the proportion of divalent cations. Conversely, when freshwater inflow into saline coastal aquifers occurs, a process referred to as freshening, the cation-exchange reaction is reversed. Freshwater of Ca-HCO3 type intrudes the saline aquifer, and exchangeable Na+ on mineral surfaces, especially clay minerals, is substituted by Ca2+ and Mg2+, leading to a change in the water type to the characteristic Na-HCO3. The Na+/Cl- ratio increases above the level of seawater, while Ca2+ as well as Mg2+ become depleted.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n6in the following steps (Appelo and Postma, 2004; Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999; Vengosh, 2013 ): In the early \nstages of salinization, fresh Ca2+-dominated groundwater is enriched in Na+and Mg2+. In general, divalent cations are exchanged on \nthe mineral surface preferentially to monovalent cations (Carroll, 1959; Steudel and Emmerich, 2013 ). However, at a certain intensity \nof salinization ion selectivity is masked by the proportional increase in sorption with increasing concentration, especially of the \nmonovalent ion Na+(Sawhney, 1972 ). In conclusion, during further salinization Na+exchanges divalent cations Ca2+and Mg2+from \nsedimentary rocks forming Ca-Cl and Na-Mg-Cl waters. Simultaneously, overall salinity increases, while also the proportion of divalent \ncations increases. \nConversely, freshwater inflow into saline coastal aquifers, also referred to as freshening, reverses the cation-exchange reaction \ncontrary to the salinization process (Appelo, 1994 ). When freshwater of Ca-HCO 3 type intrudes the saline aquifer exchangeable Na+on \nmineral surfaces, especially clay minerals, is substituted by Ca2+and Mg2+, due to a higher sorption selectivity, and the water type \nchanges to the characteristic Na-HCO 3. The Na+/Cl- ratio increases above the level of seawater, while Ca2+as well as Mg2+become \ndepleted (Appelo and Postma, 2004; Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999 ). \nIn the natural environment, Cl- often acts as a conservative tracer and ion ratios are commonly calculated relative to Cl- (Jones \net al., 1999 ). Sea water has a Na+/Cl- molar ratio of around 0.86. Due to the above-mentioned cation exchange reactions, Na+/Cl- \ndecreases below the conservative mixing line during salinization and increases during freshening. \n2.2.4. Hydrogeological model \nTo fully evaluate the fresh-saline groundwater patterns in the context of stratigraphy and depth, samples were assigned to their \nrespective aquifer based on available lithological information. As owners of private wells do not know their target aquifer and because \nno sufficient subsurface model was available for the region, a simplified hydrogeological model was constructed using lithological data \nfrom 27 borehole logs in CMP (Vuong, 2014 ), provided by the National Center for Water Resources Planning and Investigation \nVietnam (NAWAPI), whereas six of them are part of the national monitoring network. The locations of the boreholes are shown in  \nFig. 2. The model serves two purposes: (i) assignment of samples to an aquifer and hence (ii) visualization of samples in depth to \ndelineate aquifer dependent groundwater properties. A layer-based approach was chosen, where surfaces were created separately and \nFig. 2.Location of 27 boreholes (Vuong, 2014 ) and extent of the interpolation area (purple) used for the calculation of the hydrogeological model.

Based on the report, how does the increase in salinity affect the usability of groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam?	The increase in salinity in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam can substantially degrade the quality of groundwater. This degradation limits its use and can also negatively impact human health. The salinization of groundwater is primarily associated with overexploitation, which leads to a decrease in hydraulic heads and increases the potential for seawater intrusion.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What is the role of organic matter in increasing the concentration of HCO3- in coastal aquifers and how does it affect the calcium carbonate equilibria in the Mekong Delta region?	Organic matter plays a significant role in increasing the concentration of HCO3- in coastal aquifers. This happens when the organic matter is oxidized to dissolved inorganic carbon, which can lead to HCO3- concentrations surpassing those in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times. This process is particularly relevant in areas like the Mekong Delta region, where high amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers due to their marine and estuarial origin. The oxidation of organic matter also impacts the calcium carbonate equilibria. The reduction of organic matter leads to an increase in PCO2 and changes in pH, which in turn causes dissolution. Furthermore, sulfate reduction, another process linked to organic matter, directly produces HCO3- and leads to sulfate depletion. This is typical for freshening aquifers rich in organic matter, a characteristic that might also apply to the Mekong Delta region.	['Another possible source of HCO 3- in coastal aquifers is dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter, which is oxidized to \ndissolved inorganic carbon.It was shown in other studies that the concentration of HCO 3- originating from organic matter oxidation \ncan surpass the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times (Chapelle and McMahon, 1991; Orem and \nGaudette, 1984 ).In addition, organic matter reduction also shifts the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in PCO2 as well as \nchanges in pH, and causes dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999 ).Due to their marine and estuarial origin, \nhigh amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers in CMP (Doan et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2010; \nPechstein et al., 2018 ) and could therefore account for high HCO 3- concentrations.Furthermore, sulfate reduction directly produces \nHCO 3- and leads to sulfate depletion, which is typical for freshening aquifers rich in organic matter and might therefore also apply to \nFig.8.Na+/Cl- plot of groundwater samples including water type markers associated with salinization of freshwater aquifers.J.

Based on the report, how does the increase of EC values in coastal areas indicate the generation of additional HCO3- rather than recent seawater intrusion?	The increase of EC values in coastal areas can indicate the generation of additional HCO3- rather than recent seawater intrusion because the EC values can rise due to the oxidation of organic matter, which produces HCO3-. This process can lead to higher HCO3- concentrations than those found in fresh groundwater at recharge areas. Furthermore, the study found that the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the study area was well above the seawater ratio of 0.86, suggesting that the increase in EC values is not necessarily due to seawater intrusion.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n12CMP where as a consequence sulfate concentrations are rather low (Kim et al., 2017; Chapelle and McMahon, 1991 ).Overall, this is an \nimportant finding, demonstrating that the increase of EC values in coastal areas are not necessarily an evidence of recent seawater \nintrusion, but can also be attributed to the generation of additional HCO 3-.4.2.Salinization and freshening processes \nCoastal aquifers are influenced by marine transgression and regression cycles leading to seawater or freshwater intrusion, \nrespectively (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Han et al., 2020 ).Fig.8 reveals that the Na+/Cl- molar ratio of most samples in the \nstudy area is well above the seawater ratio of 0.86.Only a few samples show ratios lower than seawater.It is remarkable that the water \ntype of those samples below the seawater ratio line is changing with increasing Cl- concentration from Mix-Cl-(HCO 3) and \nCa-Cl-(HCO 3) over Na-Mg-Cl and finally to Na-Cl, while almost all samples above the seawater ratio are of Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) \ntype.This observation in surveyed data convincingly demonstrates the impact of cation exchange processes during salinization and \nfreshening.The customized water type is well suitable to reflect different stages and the geochemical processes associated with \nsalinization.It can be observed that Na-Mg-Cl seem to occur at higher Cl- concentrations compared to Ca-Cl-(HCO 3) (see Fig.8), \nprobably because seawater contains more Mg2+over Ca2+with a Mg2+/Ca2+ratio of 4.5–5.2 (Vengosh, 2013 ).The Mg2+/Cl- ratio is \nshown in Fig.9 and highest ratios correlate with those of lowest Na+/Cl- ratios and salinization water types, again demonstrating the \ncation-exchange processes.The same pattern can be observed for Ca2+/Cl- (Fig.10) but with a wider spread and deviation from the \nmixing line, as Ca2+concentrations are more influenced by other factors such as calcite precipitation and dissolution, which in turn \ndepend on HCO 3- concentrations.In conclusion, freshwater intrusion is, or was, the predominant process leading to the abundant Na-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3-(Cl) type \ngroundwater in CMP.The rarely occurring groundwater of Na-Cl type above the seawater line might be in a less advanced stage of \nfreshening, where Cl- is still the dominant anion.Further freshening produces waters of Na-HCO 3 type and Cl- below 25mg/L, as found \nin the northeast of the study area.Due to the general hydrogeological conditions, it can also be assumed that the freshening process has \nprogressed furthest in this region.This assumption is supported by Na+/Cl- molar ratios greater than 10.0 in the north-east and Na+/Cl- \nbetween 5.00 and 10.0 in the central east (Fig.7).It can be expected that both processes, cation exchange reactions and the release of organic carbon by organic matter decompo -\nsition, contribute to observed Na-HCO 3 groundwater in CMP.Detailed water type analysis in combination with the evaluation of Na+/ \nCl- molar ratios and the consideration of cation exchange processes proved to be an appropriate tool to identify signs of salinization, \neven in early stages at low Cl- concentrations.Focusing on total salinity via EC analysis alone, however, is not a suitable method.For \nexample, three samples in the central north (Fig.5c) have EC values below 1000 µS/cm (Fig.5c).However, based on their Na+/Cl- \nratio, which is below the seawater line (Fig.7), and their water type (Fig.3), particular these samples seem to be in an early stage of \nsalinization.4.3.Groundwater evolution and development \nMarine transgression and regression phases in the Quaternary (Fig.', 'Another possible source of HCO 3- in coastal aquifers is dissolved organic carbon derived from organic matter, which is oxidized to \ndissolved inorganic carbon.It was shown in other studies that the concentration of HCO 3- originating from organic matter oxidation \ncan surpass the concentration in fresh groundwater at recharge areas multiple times (Chapelle and McMahon, 1991; Orem and \nGaudette, 1984 ).In addition, organic matter reduction also shifts the calcium carbonate equilibria due to an increase in PCO2 as well as \nchanges in pH, and causes dissolution (Custodio and Bruggerman, 1987; Jones et al., 1999 ).Due to their marine and estuarial origin, \nhigh amounts of organic matter are consistently found across all stratigraphic layers in CMP (Doan et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2010; \nPechstein et al., 2018 ) and could therefore account for high HCO 3- concentrations.Furthermore, sulfate reduction directly produces \nHCO 3- and leads to sulfate depletion, which is typical for freshening aquifers rich in organic matter and might therefore also apply to \nFig.8.Na+/Cl- plot of groundwater samples including water type markers associated with salinization of freshwater aquifers.J.

Based on the report, how does the decrease in hydraulic heads in recent decades potentially contribute to the freshening of groundwater in the Mekong Delta?	The decrease in hydraulic heads due to overexploitation of groundwater in the Mekong Delta can potentially lead to seawater intrusion. This intrusion would significantly degrade the quality of the groundwater, limiting its use and potentially affecting human health. Additionally, the decrease in hydraulic heads can cause severe local land subsidence, resulting in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This does not contribute to the freshening of groundwater, but rather, it poses a threat to the quality and availability of fresh groundwater in the Mekong Delta.

What measures can be taken to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, according to the findings of the report?	The report suggests that initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development Strategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission are aimed at addressing the challenges posed by salinity intrusion and other environmental impacts.

What are the potential impacts of decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise on the survival and sedimentation of the Mekong Delta, as mentioned in the report?	The potential impacts of decreased sediment supply and accelerating rates of relative sea level rise on the survival and sedimentation of the Mekong Delta include a decrease in hydraulic heads and the potential for seawater intrusion, which could degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and affect human health. Additionally, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping, can result in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. This, in combination with additive processes, threatens the very existence of the low-lying Mekong Delta. Other impacts include natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, salinization of surface water, and heavy coastal and riverbank erosion. Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons leading to severe droughts, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise. Overall, these problems can lead to a progressive loss of land and freshwater, which could eventually result in the inundation of large parts of the delta.

Groundwater contamination in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, can lead to several negative impacts.

['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

What are the potential impacts of 25 years of groundwater extraction on land subsidence in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	"The potential impacts of 25 years of groundwater extraction on land subsidence in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, include a decrease in hydraulic heads and the potential for seawater intrusion, which could significantly degrade groundwater quality, limit its use, and affect human health. Additionally, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year could occur, which is induced by decreased pore pressure due to pumping. This results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers. In combination with other processes, the low-lying Mekong Delta is threatened in its very existence. These processes include natural compaction of the upper Holocene sediment layers, a decline of fluvial sediment supply due to upstream dam constructions, salinization of surface water, and sea-level rise due to global climate change. Some parts of the Mekong Delta are also facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion. Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons leading to severe droughts, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise. Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive ""loss of land and freshwater"", which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta."

Based on the research conducted on the Mekong Delta, how does climate change impact the groundwater resources in the region?	Climate change impacts the groundwater resources in the Mekong Delta in several ways. One of the most significant impacts is the potential for sea-level rise, which can lead to seawater intrusion into the groundwater. This intrusion can degrade the quality of the groundwater, limiting its use and potentially affecting human health. Additionally, climate change can lead to weather extremes and natural hazards, such as floods and prolonged dry seasons, which can result in severe droughts. These conditions can increase the demand for fresh groundwater. In coastal areas, the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of sea-level rise. Overall, these problems can lead to a progressive loss of land and freshwater, which could eventually result in the inundation of large parts of the delta.	['Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 40 (2022) 101010\n2Lam et al., 2018; Minderhoud et al., 2017 ).In many deltas, surface water is saline and polluted (Nguyen et al., 2019; Rahman et al., \n2019 ), and rainwater is only available during the rainy season.Therefore, groundwater is the major and most reliable source of \nfreshwater, which consequently leads to heavy overexploitation accompanied by various negative environmental impacts (Erban et al., \n2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Minderhoud et al., 2020, 2017; Werner et al., 2013 ).This also applies for the Vietnamese Mekong \nDelta (MD), the third largest delta on earth, which has around 17.3 million inhabitants (GSOV, 2019 ) and relies heavily on fresh \ngroundwater (An et al., 2014; Gunnink et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2018 ).The most prominent negative environmental impact associated \nwith groundwater overexploitation in the MD is the decrease of hydraulic heads and the potential of seawater intrusion, which would \nsubstantially degrade groundwater quality, limit its use and affect human health (Erban et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2021; Rahman et al., \n2019; Sohrabi et al., 2021 ).In addition, severe local land subsidence of several centimeters a year, which is induced by decreased pore \npressure due to pumping, results in irreversible compaction of unconsolidated sandy aquifers and highly compressible clay layers \n(Erban et al., 2014, 2013; Karlsrud et al., 2020; Minderhoud et al., 2015; Parker, 2020; Thoang and Giao, 2015 ).In combination with \nadditive processes, the low-lying MD is threatened in its very existence.Those include natural compaction of the upper Holocene \nsediment layers (Zoccarato et al., 2018 ), a decline of fluvial sediment supply transported by the Mekong River due to upstream dam \nconstructions (Allison et al., 2017; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Kummu and Varis, 2007 ), salinization of surface water (Ferguson and Gleeson, \n2012; Gugliotta et al., 2017 ) as well as sea-level rise due to global climate change (Smajgl et al., 2015; Woodroffe et al., 2007 ).Some \nparts of the MD are additionally facing heavy coastal and riverbank erosion (Anthony et al., 2015; Karlsrud et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; \nLuijendijk et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2020 ).Weather extremes and natural hazards, including floods and prolonging dry seasons \nleading to severe droughts, like in early 2020, further threaten the area and potentially increase the demand for fresh groundwater \n(Moser et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2020 ).In coastal areas the consequences of groundwater extraction often surpass the impact of \nsea-level rise (Erban et al., 2014; Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012 ).Overall, the problems can be summarized as a progressive “loss of land \nand freshwater ”, which will eventually lead to inundation of large parts of the delta (Minderhoud et al., 2020 ).As this was \nacknowledged in the last years by researchers and decision makers, initiatives like the Mekong Delta Plan and Basin Development \nStrategy Plan by the Mekong Delta Commission aim to solve abovementioned challenges, reduce groundwater overexploitation, and \nwork towards a sustainable development of the MD (MDP, 2013 ; MRC, 2016 ).In order to forecast the future development of groundwater resources in the MD, it is essential to understand the hydrogeological \nFig.1.(a) Schematic overview of CMP in Vietnam and (b) satellite overview of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta in South-East Asia.HCMC=Ho-Chi-Minh-City (Sources of satellite image: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, \nswisstopo, and the GIS User Community).J.

"""What are the main causes of soil salinization and how does it affect agricultural production, particularly rice cultivation, in the Mekong Delta?"""	The main causes of soil salinization in the Mekong Delta, specifically in Hau Giang province, are seawater intrusion and salinized groundwater. This accumulation of soluble salts in the soil can negatively impact agricultural production by making productive land areas unsuitable for farming or reducing crop yield. In terms of rice cultivation, the use of salt-tolerant crop varieties, suitable irrigation methods, and lime (CaCO3) can help reduce the adverse effects of salinity on agricultural land areas affected with a moderate level of total soluble salts.

Saltwater intrusion can have several negative impacts on agricultural production in coastal regions like the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. It can impair plant uptake of water and essential nutrients, negatively affect crop growth and development, and increase weed competition. It can also lower soil microbial activity and overall crop productivity. This process is driven by both natural and anthropogenic factors, including climate change, sea-level rise, and drought. Droughts can lead to particularly severe saltwater intrusion events as lack of rainfall leads to scarce river discharge and favors marine water inland flow intrusion.

"""What are the impacts of saltwater intrusion and climate change on coastal agriculture, as discussed in the 2023 study by Tarolli et al.?"""	Saltwater intrusion and climate change pose significant threats to coastal agriculture. Changing climatic conditions, including sea-level rise and drought, are causing progressive land degradation, particularly in river deltas. This degradation negatively impacts the sustainable development of agriculture, society, and economy. Saltwater intrusion, a process resulting from both natural and anthropogenic drivers, puts freshwater sources near the sea at risk. Droughts can exacerbate this issue by reducing river discharge and promoting the inland flow of marine water. The impacts on agricultural production are manifold, including impaired plant uptake of water and essential nutrients, negative effects on crop growth and development, increased weed competition, reduced soil microbial activity, and overall crop productivity reduction. The study also presents the Po River Delta and the Mekong Delta as critical regions experiencing severe saltwater intrusion.

"""What factors have led to the increased frequency of arid conditions and saltwater intrusion in the Po River delta, and how has this impacted the area's natural resources and agricultural productivity?"""	The increased frequency of arid conditions and saltwater intrusion in the Po River delta has been caused by several factors. These include the pumping of groundwater, reduced river flow due to damming and irrigation, rising sea levels, and subsidence. Subsidence, in particular, was caused by large extractions of methane from the subsoil in the 1950s and 60s. Climate change has significantly worsened these factors, leading to increasingly frequent arid conditions. These changes have had severe impacts on the area's natural resources and agricultural productivity. Soil salinization, habitat loss, and reduced agricultural productivity are among the major consequences. In the last two decades, there have been six episodes of drought, characterized by low discharge of the Po River, which has favored the intrusion of saltwater along the delta's tributaries. This has resulted in water salinity exceeding the critical threshold for irrigation, leading to water shortages, soil fertility deterioration, vegetation loss, and micro desertification of large field portions.

What are the four main factors driving the intrusion of saltwater in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, and how does this intrusion impact the cultivation of rice paddies?	The four main factors driving the intrusion of saltwater in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam are upstream hydropower dams, land subsidence, the relative sea-level rise, and riverbed sand mining. This saltwater intrusion has led to the deterioration of soil quality, making it difficult to cultivate rice paddies. The salinity of the water surface increases as seawater intrudes into the Hau and Tien rivers, extending to significant distances from the coastline. This has drawn significant attention from various sectors due to its impact on Vietnam's rice production, as the country is the world's second-largest rice exporter.

How could climate change potentially impact the cultivation of rice in areas with a cold semi-arid climate like the Mekong Delta, according to the report by Tarolli et al.?	Climate change could potentially lead to higher temperatures and hot summers in areas with a cold semi-arid climate, shifting it to a hot semi-arid climate zone. This could result in an increase in the frequency of heat waves, which could have significant impacts on agriculture, including the cultivation of rice. To mitigate these impacts, the report suggests several strategies. These include physical mitigation of seawater intrusion, promoting and optimally designing rainwater harvesting facilities, implementing soil remediation strategies, and adapting coastal agriculture to extreme conditions. This could involve promoting crops that are more tolerant to drought and soil salinization, focusing on potential breeding and genetic modification strategies for improving salt tolerance, or preferring autumn/winter crops instead of summer crops.

"""What are the four critical aspects proposed in the report to mitigate the impacts of saltwater intrusion and climate change on agriculture in arid climate zones like the Mekong Delta?"""	The report proposes four critical aspects to mitigate the impacts of saltwater intrusion and climate change on agriculture in arid climate zones. Firstly, physical mitigation of seawater intrusion is suggested, which involves providing shallow mobile barriers that can act when the river’s discharge reaches critically low levels, stopping the inland flow of saltwater. Secondly, promoting and optimally designing rainwater harvesting facilities is recommended. These facilities can provide fresh water for irrigation and public supply during drought conditions. Thirdly, implementing soil remediation strategies is proposed. This involves increasing the organic carbon content in soils to improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and promote beneficial microbial activity. Lastly, the report suggests the adaptation of coastal agriculture to extreme conditions. This could involve promoting crops that are more tolerant to drought and soil salinization, and potentially focusing on breeding and genetic modification strategies for improving salt tolerance.

Based on the context, what are the impacts of saline water intrusion on the agricultural landscape of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	The intrusion of saline water into the Mekong Delta in Vietnam has led to significant impacts on the agricultural landscape. This phenomenon has resulted in the deterioration of soil quality, making it difficult to cultivate rice paddies. The salinity of the water surface increases as seawater intrudes into the Hau and Tien rivers, extending to 45–65 km and 55–60 km from the coastline, respectively. This has drawn significant attention from both domestic and international private and public sectors, as well as scientists. The severity of saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta is expected to increase in the dry season of 2023, further threatening the rice supply in the foreseeable future.

What is the willingness to pay of farm households in the Mekong River Delta for a salinity intrusion risk reduction program, and how does it vary depending on the current and expected impact of salinity intrusion on agricultural productivity?	Over half of the farm households in the Mekong River Delta are willing to contribute to a fund aimed at reducing the risk of salinity intrusion. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity on their farms. Those households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in areas with lower or no current risk. However, even households not currently affected by salinity intrusion are willing to contribute to a salinity management program. The total amount that these households are prepared to pay is significant and could potentially cover the total costs of such a program.	['The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use', 'The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;']
What are the two processes causing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta and what is the predicted impact on the agricultural area by 2030?	The two processes causing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta are rising sea levels due to adverse climate change and a significant decline in river flows as a result of upstream dam construction and increased extractions of water. By 2030, under current sea level increase predictions, it is estimated that up to 45% of the Mekong River Delta agricultural area could be impacted by salinity intrusion.	['In  recent  years,  however,  salinity  intrusion  has  become  the  most\nsigniﬁcant  challenge  faced  by  farm  households.Salinity  intrusion\nis  caused  by  two  processes:  a)  rising  sea  levels  as  a  result  of  adverse\nclimate  change  and  b)  a  signiﬁcant  decline  in  river  ﬂows  as  a  result\nof  upstream  dam  construction  and  increased  extractions  of  water.Reduced  upstream  ﬂow  rates  combined  with  increased  sea  lev-\n∗Corresponding author.E-mail addresses:  tiendung.khong@adelaide.edu.au ,  ktdung@ctu.edu.vn\n(T.D.Khong).els  under  climate  change  drive  lower  hydrologic  pressure  in  the\nMRD,  which  allows  salt  water  to  intrude  further  inland  (Danh  and\nKhai,  2014 ;  Le  Anh  Tuan  et  al.,  2007 ;  Smajgl  et  al.,  2015 ).According\nto  the  Vietnam  Academy  for  Water  Resources,  salinity  intrusion  is\non  the  increase  and  has  recently  been  detected  in  the  Kien  Giang\nand  Hau  Giang  provinces  (see  Fig.1)  (The  Vietnam  Academy  for\nWater  Resources,  2015 ).Currently,  around  620,000  ha  are  affected\nby  salinity  intrusion—roughly  16%  of  the  total  MRD  agricultural  pro-\nduction  area.By  2030  under  current  sea  level  increase  predictions,\nit  is  estimated  that  up  to  45%  of  the  MRD  agricultural  area  could\nbe  impacted,  with  coastal  provinces  such  as  Tien  Giang,  Tra  Vinh,\nSoc  Trang,  Bac  Lieu,  Ca  Mau,  and  Ben  Tre  experiencing  the  highest\nlevels  of  impact  (Center  of  Environmental  Engineering,  2012) .Adverse  impacts  of  sea  level  rise  are  being  worsened  by  increas-\ning  upstream  development  along  the  Mekong  River.The  National\nHydro-Meteorological  Service  of  Vietnam  is  warning  that  the\nimpact  of  future  droughts,  similar  to  those  experienced  during  the\n2015  and  2016  El  Ni˜no  events,  will  also  be  worse  in  future,  creating\nfurther  negative  salinity  intrusion  outcomes.As  one  of  the  largest  rice  exporters  in  Asia,  disruptions  to\nMRD  agricultural  production  can  result  in  wider  serious  regional\nfood  security  issues,  as  well  as  reduced  national  trade  income.In  the  past,  MRD  farm  households  largely  treated  salinity  intru-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.12.010\n0378-3774/© 2017  Elsevier  B.V.

This could help control the intrusion of saltwater into the delta. However, the cost of such a project and how much households could contribute to it is a significant consideration. A long-term solution could be for farmers to adapt to the salinity intrusion. This could involve transitioning from rice production to fish or shrimp farming, which are more tolerant of saline conditions. The challenges faced in implementing these solutions include the significant financial cost of infrastructure projects like sea-dikes, and the potential disruption to traditional farming practices and livelihoods if farmers are required to switch from rice to fish or shrimp farming. Furthermore, the problem of salinity intrusion is being exacerbated by climate change, which is causing sea levels to rise, and by upstream dam construction and increased water extraction, which are reducing river flows. These factors are increasing the hydrologic pressure in the Mekong River Delta, allowing saltwater to intrude further inland. This makes it more difficult to manage and control salinity intrusion.	['The  next  issue  to  consider  is  the\nquestion  of  how  much  money  might  be  needed  to  fund  an  effec-\ntive salinity intrusion  control  program,  and  how  much  households\ncould  contribute  to  the  cost  of  running  such  a  program.As  shown  in\nFig.3,  and  according  to  Danh  (2012) ,  one  option  is  to  build  around\n1469  km  of  concrete  sea-dikes.Accepting  this  as  a  possible  scenario,\nand  noting  that:\na) it  may  be  possible  for  many  farmers  to  live  with  and  adapt  to\nsalinity  intrusion  by  doing  such  things  as  moving  from  rice  pro-\nduction  to  ﬁsh  or  shrimp  farming;', 'In  recent  years,  however,  salinity  intrusion  has  become  the  most\nsigniﬁcant  challenge  faced  by  farm  households.Salinity  intrusion\nis  caused  by  two  processes:  a)  rising  sea  levels  as  a  result  of  adverse\nclimate  change  and  b)  a  signiﬁcant  decline  in  river  ﬂows  as  a  result\nof  upstream  dam  construction  and  increased  extractions  of  water.Reduced  upstream  ﬂow  rates  combined  with  increased  sea  lev-\n∗Corresponding author.E-mail addresses:  tiendung.khong@adelaide.edu.au ,  ktdung@ctu.edu.vn\n(T.D.Khong).els  under  climate  change  drive  lower  hydrologic  pressure  in  the\nMRD,  which  allows  salt  water  to  intrude  further  inland  (Danh  and\nKhai,  2014 ;  Le  Anh  Tuan  et  al.,  2007 ;  Smajgl  et  al.,  2015 ).According\nto  the  Vietnam  Academy  for  Water  Resources,  salinity  intrusion  is\non  the  increase  and  has  recently  been  detected  in  the  Kien  Giang\nand  Hau  Giang  provinces  (see  Fig.1)  (The  Vietnam  Academy  for\nWater  Resources,  2015 ).Currently,  around  620,000  ha  are  affected\nby  salinity  intrusion—roughly  16%  of  the  total  MRD  agricultural  pro-\nduction  area.By  2030  under  current  sea  level  increase  predictions,\nit  is  estimated  that  up  to  45%  of  the  MRD  agricultural  area  could\nbe  impacted,  with  coastal  provinces  such  as  Tien  Giang,  Tra  Vinh,\nSoc  Trang,  Bac  Lieu,  Ca  Mau,  and  Ben  Tre  experiencing  the  highest\nlevels  of  impact  (Center  of  Environmental  Engineering,  2012) .Adverse  impacts  of  sea  level  rise  are  being  worsened  by  increas-\ning  upstream  development  along  the  Mekong  River.The  National\nHydro-Meteorological  Service  of  Vietnam  is  warning  that  the\nimpact  of  future  droughts,  similar  to  those  experienced  during  the\n2015  and  2016  El  Ni˜no  events,  will  also  be  worse  in  future,  creating\nfurther  negative  salinity  intrusion  outcomes.As  one  of  the  largest  rice  exporters  in  Asia,  disruptions  to\nMRD  agricultural  production  can  result  in  wider  serious  regional\nfood  security  issues,  as  well  as  reduced  national  trade  income.In  the  past,  MRD  farm  households  largely  treated  salinity  intru-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.12.010\n0378-3774/© 2017  Elsevier  B.V.

Based on the report, are local households in the Mekong River Delta willing to contribute to programs aimed at mitigating the risk of salinity intrusion, and if so, how much are they willing to contribute?	Yes, local households in the Mekong River Delta are willing to contribute to programs aimed at mitigating the risk of salinity intrusion. Over 50% of farm households expressed a willingness to contribute to a fund for this purpose. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity. Those in areas currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in lower or no-current risk areas. However, even those currently unaffected by salinity intrusion are willing to contribute. The total amount that farm households are prepared to pay is significant and may be sufficient to cover the total costs of such a program. The exact amount they are willing to contribute was not specified in the context.

What factors have been identified in previous studies that influence a farm household's willingness to pay for climate change risk reduction programs, such as those aimed at managing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta?	The factors identified that influence a farm household's willingness to pay for climate change risk reduction programs, such as those aimed at managing salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta, include the level of risk they currently face from salinity intrusion and the expected impact of salinity on their farms. Households located in areas currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to contribute to risk reduction programs than those in lower or no-current risk areas. However, even households that are currently unaffected by salinity intrusion have shown a willingness to contribute to a salinity management program. The total amount that households are prepared to pay is significant and may be sufficient to cover the costs of such a program.

What were the five different bid values chosen for the monthly payment vehicle in the survey conducted among farm households in the Mekong River Delta, and what was their equivalent in US dollars?	The five different bid values chosen for the monthly payment vehicle in the survey conducted among farm households in the Mekong River Delta were VND 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, and 250,000. Their equivalent in US dollars were $2.20, $4.41, $6.61, $8.81, and $11.02 respectively.	['As stated above,  in  our  CVM  survey  farm  households  were  asked\nto  respond  to  the  willingness  to  pay  bid  value  question  in  one  of\nthree  ways:  ‘Yes,’  ‘No’  or  ‘Do  not  know’.In  the  analysis  model  /H9251  and\nˇ  are  coefﬁcients,  and  X  is  a  vector  of  the  socio-economic  explana-\ntory  variables  related  to  an  individual’s  selection  including:  farm\nhousehold  income,  head  of  household’s  age,  head  of  household’s\ngender,  farm  household  size,  head  of  household’s  education  and\ntotal  farming  experience  (Table  1).The  non-parametric  technique  is\nemployed  to  estimate  the  mean  values  for  WTP.This  technique  was\nsuggested  by  previous  researchers  in  the  same  survey  area  (Ðan\nand  Duyên,  2010 ;

What are the proposed program options for reducing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta, and how would they be funded according to the survey conducted?	The proposed program options for reducing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta include converting current earth sea-dike-walls to concrete structures, upgrading existing or building new river-mouth sluicegate systems, and planting new or reforesting degraded existing mangrove systems next to sea-dike-walls. According to the survey conducted, households were asked if they would be willing to contribute monthly to fund these programs. The collected funds would be administered by a committee consisting of local government, local and international consultants, and representatives from non-government organizations. This committee would then decide how to invest in concrete sea-dike-walls, sluice-gate construction, and mangrove forest in their local area. The programs aim to reduce current and expected future salinity intrusion risk in their relevant village area.

"""What methods were used in the study to reduce the likelihood of over-estimations in the willingness to pay for managing salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?"""	The study used a referendum style format to collect willingness to pay bids. Respondents were given three options: 'Yes', 'No', or 'Do not know' (‘DK’). They were also given an opportunity to reconsider their vote before nominating their specific monthly payment bid. Each possible willingness to pay bid value was provided to at least 30 of the randomly selected farm households, for a total of 150 observations from each area. This approach simplifies the respondent’s cognitive task, which is an important factor in survey areas where farm households are surveyed.

"""What are the socio-economic factors considered in the survey to determine a farm household's willingness to pay for measures against salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?"""	The survey considered several socio-economic factors to determine a farm household's willingness to pay for measures against salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta. These included the household's location, whether they were in areas already affected by salinity intrusion, areas with a high probability and risk of future salinity intrusion, or areas where salinity intrusion is not yet a concern. The survey also considered the household's experience with farming, with a requirement of at least three years of farming experience. Additionally, the survey took into account the household's perceptions of local climate change and salinity impacts.	['The  robustness  of  the  decision  to\nadopt  a  dichotomous  choice  format  was  enhanced  in  this  instance\nby  a  large  sample  of  farm  households.2.1.Survey  method\nThe  primary  data  for  the  study  was  obtained  through  a  ﬁeld\nsurvey  conducted  among  farm  households  in  the  MRD.The\nquestionnaire  was  pre-tested  with  30  randomly-selected  farm\nhousehold  heads  spread  across  three  MRD  study  areas  ranging  from\nheavily  salinity-affected  areas,  down  to  non-salinity-affected  areas.The  purpose  of  the  pre-test  was  to  check  likely  farmer  comprehen-\nsion  of  the  questionnaire,  reﬁne  the  range  of  willingness  to  pay\nbid  measures  proposed,  and  test  the  viability  of  the  proposed  pay-\nment  vehicle;  that  is,  the  feasibility  of  getting  farmers  to  make  a\nmonthly  contribution  to  a  fund  managed  by  their  local  authority.Based on  the  pre-test  results,  ﬁve  different  bid  values  were  chosen\nfor  the  monthly  payment  vehicle:  VND  50,000,  100,000,  150,000,200,000  and  250,000  (equivalent  to  US$12.20,  $4.41,  $6.61,  $8.81\nand $11.02).Following  the  survey  pretests  and  content  ﬁnalization,  the  for-\nmal  in-ﬁeld  face-to-face  survey  data  collection  commenced.The\nsurvey  sample  areas  were  based  on  an  MRD  salinity  intrusion  map\nprovided  by  the  local  department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Devel-\nopment.The  opinion of local  departmental  staff  as  to  which  areas\nmight  present  useful  sample  sites  was  also  sought.As  a  result  of  this\nexercise,  the  survey  was  directed  at  three  farmer  groups:  i)  those\nwhere  salinity intrusion  impacts  are  already  prevalent  (the  Cau  Ke\ndistrict);  ii)  those  living  in  areas  with  a  high  probability  and  risk\nof  future  salinity  intrusion  (the  Tra  On  district  and  part  of  the  Cau\nKe  district);  and  iii)  a  control  group-area  where  salinity  intrusion  is\nnot  yet of  concern  (the  Vinh  Thanh  district  in  the  Can  Tho  province).Using  simple  random  sampling  techniques,  farm  households  were\nrandomly  selected  from  a  list  provided  by  district  local  authorities.Once  selected,  a  survey  enumerator2visited  the  household  to  ascer-\ntain  eligibility  for  survey  participation.To  be  selected,  the  head  of\nthe  farm  household  or  their  partner  had  to  live  in  the  area,  work\non  an  MRD  rice  ﬁeld,  and  have  at  least  three  years’  farming  expe-\nrience.Eligible  respondents  were  then  asked  some  demographic\nand  social  characteristic  questions.This  was  followed  by  questions\nrelated  to  their  perceptions  of  local  climate  change,  and  then  salin-\nity  impacts.3\nDue  to  the  importance  of  collecting  reliable  willingness  to  pay\ninformation,  causes  of  salinity  intrusion  in  the  Mekong  River  Delta\nwere  ﬁrst  explained  carefully  to  respondents.', 'The  results  reveal  that\nmore  than  50  percent  of  farm  households  are  willing  to  contribute\nto  a  fund  that  could  be  used  to  reduce  salinity  intrusion  risk,  and\nthat their willingness  to  pay  is  in  proportion  to  expected  salin-\nity  impacts.Farm  households  in  current  salinity  intrusion-affected\nareas  are  more  willing  to  pay  for  risk  reduction  programs  than  those\nfarm  households  located  in  lower  or  no-current  risk  areas.How-\never,  all  farm  households  included  in  the  study—including  those\nwho  at  present  are  unaffected  by  salinity  intrusion—are  willing  to\npay  for  an  MRD  salinity  management  program.When  assessed  in  aggregate,  the  total  amount  of  money  that\nfarm  households  are  prepared  to  pay  is  signiﬁcant,  and  may  be  suf-\nﬁcient  to  cover  the  total  costs  of  such  a  program.Care  must  be\ntaken,  however  in  the  interpretation  of  this  result.While  the  pay-\nment  vehicle  adopted  in  this  study  suggests  feasibility,  work  on\nthe  most  appropriate  government  arrangements  requires  further\nanalysis.Careful  research,  for  example,  on  the  merits  of  establish-\ning  a  separate  salinity  intrusion  control  authority  versus  the  use']

"""What were the main reasons why some farm households in the Mekong Delta were unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program?"""	The main reasons why some farm households in the Mekong Delta were unwilling to contribute to the proposed salinity reduction program included: they could not afford the amount, they did not believe the amount they would pay would actually be used for the program, they felt it was the government's responsibility, they had their own adaptation options, and other unspecified reasons.	['This  included  a  range\nof  hypothetical  salinity  reduction  program  options.Possible  pro-\ngram  options  suggested  in  this  survey  included  converting  current\nearth  sea-dike-walls  to  concrete  structures,  upgrading  existing  or\nbuilding  new  river-mouth  sluicegate  systems,  and  the  planting  of\nnew  or  reforestation  of  degraded  existing  mangrove  systems  next\nto  sea-dike-walls.Each  respondent  was  then  asked  whether  or  not\nthey  (their  household)  would  be  willing  to  contribute  monthly  to\nfund  such  programs.They  were  told  that  the  program  funds  would\nbe  administered  by  a  committee  including  their  local  government,\nlocal  and  international  consultants,  and  representatives  from  non-\ngovernment  organizations.This  committee  would  then  decide  how\nto  invest  in  concrete  sea-dike-walls,  sluice-gate  construction  and\nmangrove  forest  in  their  local  area.It  was  made  clear  that  these  pro-\ngrams  would  seek  to  reduce  current  and  expected  future  salinity\nintrusion  risk  in  their  relevant  village  area.Following  the  guidelines  from  Arrow  et  al.(1993)  and\nCompetition Commission  (2010) ,  willingness  to  pay  bids  were  col-\nlected using  a  referendum  style  format  where  respondents  could\nselect  one  of  three  options:  ‘Yes’,  ‘No’,  or  ‘Do  not  know’  (‘DK’).During  the  survey,  respondents  were  given  an  opportunity  to\nreconsider  their  vote  before  asking  them  to  nominate  their  speciﬁc\nmonthly  payment  bid.Each  possible  willingness  to  pay  bid  value\nwas  provided  to  at  least  30  of  the  randomly  selected  farm  house-\nholds,  for  a  total  of  150  observations  from  each  area.After  data\ncleaning,  there  were  4414useable  observations  from  three  different\nsalinity-impact  areas.Despite  some  disadvantages  with  referen-\ndum  approaches,  such  as  a  limited  range  for  the  bid-values  offered,\nthis  option  simpliﬁes  the  respondent’s  cognitive  task  (Pearce  et  al.,\n2002 )  which  is  an  important  factor  in  survey  areas  where  farm\n1US$1  dollar  was

farm  household  income  and  bid  valueare  strongly  correlated  with  increased  probability  of  willingness  to\npay;  that  is,  high  farm  income  correlates  with  a  positive

What does the report suggest about the proportion of farmers in the control group and other groups who were unsure about the bid levels in the study on salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta?	The report suggests that the proportion of farmers in the control group who were unsure about the bid levels rapidly fell to zero. However, in the other groups, the proportion of farmers who answered 'Do not know' to the bid levels remained positive, albeit at relatively low levels, averaging around 4%.

Based on the study, what is the willingness of Mekong River Delta farm households to contribute financially towards projects aimed at mitigating the impacts of salinity intrusion?	The study indicates that over half of the farm households in the Mekong River Delta are willing to contribute financially to a fund aimed at reducing the risk of salinity intrusion. Their willingness to pay is proportional to the expected impacts of salinity. Those households currently affected by salinity intrusion are more willing to pay for risk reduction programs than those in lower or no-current risk areas. However, even those households not currently affected by salinity intrusion are willing to contribute to a salinity management program. The total amount that these households are prepared to pay is significant and could potentially cover the total costs of such a program.

What is the significance of the sea-dike map in relation to the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	The sea-dike map is significant in relation to the Mekong River Delta (MRD) in Vietnam as it represents a potential long-term solution to manage increasing salinity intrusion and flooding in the region. The MRD is a vast floodplain only 0-4 meters above mean sea level and has been experiencing abnormal salinity intrusion. Over the last 300 years, more than 11,000 kilometers of canals and approximately 2000 kilometers of dike walls have been constructed to mitigate flooding. The Vietnamese government has considered upgrading dike walls and increasing maintenance in the central and southern MRD, including the construction of additional earthen sea-dikes and concrete sluice gates along the coastline. However, due to a shortage of suitable soils and high erosion rates, the construction of concrete sea-dike walls is being considered. The total length of required sea-dike walls in MRD would be 1469 kilometers, but due to public budget constraints, Vietnam may not be able to afford to build the total required lengths.

What is the estimated cost of constructing concrete sea-dike-walls of different heights across rural Vietnam to control salinity intrusion, according to the context?	The estimated cost of constructing concrete sea-dike-walls across rural Vietnam varies depending on the height of the walls. For a two-meter high wall, the cost is approximately US$1.16 million per kilometer. This cost increases to US$1.93 million per kilometer for a three-meter high wall, and to US$2.79 million per kilometer for a four-meter high wall. The total funding required for the construction across the identified coastal area of the Mekong River Delta would be approximately US$1.7 billion for two-meter walls, US$2.8 billion for three-meter walls, and US$4.1 billion for four-meter walls.

What measures have been proposed to adapt to the rising sea level in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta, according to the context provided?	Several measures have been proposed to adapt to the rising sea level in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta. These include changing irrigation schedules, increasing water storage in dams, and altering rice-planting times. These solutions are considered short-term fixes. For long-term solutions, public intervention is deemed necessary. One such long-term approach is the construction of concrete sea-dikes or embankment structures to prevent water inundation onto low-lying floodplain areas. The Vietnamese government has also issued a decree to upgrade dike walls and increase maintenance in the central and southern Mekong River Delta. This includes the construction of additional earthen sea-dikes and concrete sluice gates along the coastline. Another consideration is the construction of concrete sea-dike walls. However, due to budget constraints, it may not be possible to build the total required lengths of sea-dike walls. Another adaptation strategy is for farmers to live with and adapt to salinity intrusion by transitioning from rice production to fish or shrimp farming.

What are the challenges faced by agriculture in the Mekong Delta due to changing climate, amplified tidal effects, and saltwater intrusion, and how does it affect the productivity of acid sulfate soils?	The Mekong Delta faces several challenges due to changing climate, amplified tidal effects, and saltwater intrusion. These changes have made Vietnam one of the world's most vulnerable climate risk countries. The delta floodwater control system is being modified to encourage farmers to diversify their cropping systems and be more attentive to the environmental impacts of agriculture. However, farmers are challenged to make a living under these stressful and uncertain conditions. They continue to seek innovative water management and drainage approaches and adapt cropping systems to changing soil-water conditions. The productivity of acid sulfate soils is affected by these changes. Understanding the chemical and biogeophysical properties and pedogenic processes of acid sulfate soils, developing climate-flexible crops and management systems, and increasing crop genetic tolerances to Aluminum and salt concentrations are foundational to effective delta agricultural adaptation. The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS2 buildup leading to reduced agriculture productivity, degrades surface water quality, and makes aquatic ecosystems vulnerable. A changing climate has altered the predictable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes and made it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops. This is again challenging the region to ratchet up their adaptation and agricultural production strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and that Vietnamese farmers are able to make a living. Continuous research and experimentation will be needed to respond and prepare for present and future uncertainties.	['86A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4security and rural livelihoods (World Bank \n2022; Loc et al.2021).According to the World Bank (2022), Vietnam is among the world’s most vulnerable climate risk coun -\ntries, ranked 13th among 180 countries by Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index 2000 to 2019.In response to these changing condi -\ntions, the delta floodwater control system is being modified to encourage farmers to diversify their cropping systems and be more attentive to the environmental impacts of agriculture (Luu et al.2022).Vietnam Resolution 120/2017/NQ-CP , issued in 2017, promotes “living with floods,” “uncertainty adaptation,” and nature-based approaches for addressing climate change and upstream develop -\nment (Luu et al.2022).Delta farmers are challenged to make a living under these stressful and uncertain conditions.They continue to seek innovative water management and drainage approaches and adapt cropping systems to changing soil-water conditions, building on their accumulated local knowledge and sci -\nentific findings gained from laboratory and field experiments.Understanding the chemical and biogeophysical prop -\nerties and pedogenic processes of acid sulfate soils, developing climate-flexible crops and management systems as well as increasing crop genetic tolerances to Al and salt concentrations are foundational to effective delta agricultural adaptation.TRANSFORMING A LARGE TROPICAL \nDELTA INTO AN AGRICULTURAL \nLANDSCAPE \nFresh water for agriculture and drinking has for centuries been scarce during the long five-month dry season with saline water incursions making the acidic delta soils less productive for crops and the shallow ground water salty and not safe for cooking or drinking (Taylor 2014).Historically this wild, untamed, vast flood-plain was sparsely settled with agriculture and small settlements on marine sandy coastal dunes—fresh water oases—cre-ated as flooding and river sediments built out the delta.It was not until the French colonization (1800s) and Vietnamese state (1980s) undertook large irrigation pro -\ngrams to construct canals to channel fresh water from the Mekong and Bassac riv -\ners to reduce water and soil salinity that agricultural systems replaced the wetland ecosystem (Taylor 2014; Luu et al.2022).At first natural waterways were straight-\nened and deepened, and then connected by canals.The French Colonial Government set about clearing forests and draining wetlands to turn the underutilized and agriculturally unproductive soils into rice production.These sparsely populated, densely vegetated acid sulfate lands were used by resistance fighters as hideouts dur -\ning the US Vietnam War (1961 to 1973).After the war, the Vietnam state established large-scale state farms (1,000 to 10,000 ha [2,471 to 24,710 ac]) to increase the delta population and alleviate serious food shortages (van Mensvoort 1996).Newly resettled farmers were inexperienced in managing waterlogged acid sulfate soils to make them productive, and the state farms were inadequately funded with a shortage of knowledge and equipment resources as well as insufficient farm workers for large-scale parcels.Excess water on the landscape in monsoon season alternating with dry season freshwater scarcity made delta living conditions harsh, and most of these collective farms failed to grow enough food for farmers to make a living (van Mensvoort 1996).By the mid-1980s irrigation projects \nexpanded throughout the delta to create a freshwater network across the entire pen-insula with sluice gates that protected the waterway grid from saline intrusion and reengineered the waterscape to drain and control water for rice agriculture (Taylor 2014).Rice establishes and grows well in waterlogged environments but is sensitive to salinity with an electric conductivity (EC\nSPE) threshold of 3 dS m–1 (Korres et \nal.2022).The saline delta rivers, wetlands, and marshes were converted into peren-nial freshwater zones.This reduced the seasonal variation in water flow patterns, converted the flood plain into regulated canals, dykes, and polders that irrigated agriculture, and prevented annual flood waters from submerging fields (and sedi -\nments from replenishing soil fertility) (Luu et.2022).T oday’s Vietnam Mekong Delta agri -\ncultural landscape is built on managing and controlling the quantity and distri-bution of water year round (flooding, irrigation, fresh and saline waters) in allu -\nvial and acid sulfate soils (figure 2).', '91A\nJULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4 JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONLIVING WITH SALINITY: AGRICULTURAL \nADAPTATIONS TO SALINE ACID \nSULFATE SOILS\nOne meter (3.3 ft) of sea-level rise would \ninundate 79% of Ca Mau and 76% of Kien Giang provinces in the Vietnam Mekong Delta.The World Bank (2022) predicts that without adaptation, 45% of the delta will be affected by salinity.Below are eight rec -\nommendations to guide Vietnam Mekong Delta policymakers, scientists, local leaders, and farmers in effectively adapting and liv -\ning with salinity while continuing to make acid sulfate soils productive and delta eco -\nsystems sustainable and healthy: \n1. widen the adoption of di versified \ncropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization;\n2. incr ease research, field evaluations, and \napplications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improve plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater;\n3. incr ease freshwater flows and aquifer \nrecharge to offset saltwater intrusion;\n4. pr oactively prepare and protect lands \nand settlements to increase resilience against tropical cyclones;

and\n8. r estrict new development in eco-\nsensitive and fragile environmental regions, and strengthen and enforce land use regulations.CONCLUSION: UNCERTAINTY \nADAPTATION \nThe 1980s “rice first” policy promoted engineered ditches, canals, and sluice gates that provided freshwater irrigation, managed flooding, eliminated saltwater intrusion and drained acid sulfate soils to reclaim thousands of hectares for the intensification of rice production (Olson and Morton 2018; Ngan et al.2018; Luu et al.2022).While Vietnamese Mekong Delta farmers have learned over the decades to manage flood-drought cycles in acid sulfate soils, the increasing instability in global cli-mate and local weather conditions present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges.The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS\n2 buildup leading to reduced \nagriculture productivity, degrades surface water quality, and makes aquatic ecosys -\ntems vulnerable (Tully et al.2019; Mosley et al.2017).A changing climate has altered the \npredicable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes and made it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops.Climate change, sea level rise, human land use management, increased population, and the rise in food and nutrition insecurity is again challenging the region to ratchet up their adaptation and agricultural pro -\nduction strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and that Vietnamese farmers are able to make a living.Local and indigenous farmer knowl-\nedge and university scientific research have combined to create innovative land man-agement approaches, engineer extensive water management projects, and develop salt-tolerant crop varieties to make acid sulfate soils agriculturally productive.Continuous research and experimentation will be needed to respond and prepare for present and future uncertainties.Adaptive integration of biogeophysical, \npedogenic, and social knowledge is critical in deepening understanding of landscape and local surface level drainage impacts and soil-water relationships under increas -\ningly variable conditions.Observing and learning more about the connections and synergies among rates of percolation, soil management effects on macropores and mesopores, the role of bypass flows in raised bed soil leaching processes, densities and types of beneficial bacteria in pro-ductive soils, and plant breeding for salt tolerance will be essential to living with uncertainty and strengthening delta sus -\ntainability and resilience.']

What measures are being taken to control salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how does the changing climate, including sea level rise and drought periods, exacerbate saltwater intrusion into the region's coastal groundwater tables?	Several measures are being taken to control salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta. These include water control projects such as high dyke and flood control, salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture, and salinity control in brackish water aquaculture. Canals are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements, and during the rainy season, these canals are used to drain the land and release flood waters back into rivers. Sluice gates are also used to allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide, and are closed during the dry season and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields.The changing climate exacerbates saltwater intrusion into the region's coastal groundwater tables in several ways. Sea level rise, seasonal and increasingly variable cyclones, coastal storms, and high tides flood coastal regions and push seawater upriver, mixing with fresh water. The onset of the dry season is accompanied by receding waters and shifting salinity concentrations in the waterways. Drought periods can further exacerbate saltwater intrusion as freshwater flow rates decrease, allowing saline water to move further inland.	['Water control projects consist of high dyke and flood control, salinity control to enable freshwater agriculture, and salinity control in brackish water aquaculture (Ngan et al 2018).Canals that link to the Bassac and Mekong main stem rivers and their dis -\ntributaries are used to provide fresh water to agriculture and settlements.During the rainy season, many of these same canals are used to drain the land and release flood waters back into rivers and the West and East China Seas (Ngan et al 2018; Hanhart et al.1997).Extensive agricultural drain-age ditches and canals lower the water table and speed up hydrologic exchanges between the coastal landscape and the ocean which can increase salt concentra -\ntion (Tully et al.2019).Sluice gates allow fields to drain after flooding and during low tide and are closed during the dry sea -\nson and high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to drain agricultural fields (figure 2).ACID SULFATE SOILS OF THE VIETNAM \nMEKONG DELTA \nAcid sulfate soils occupy more than 40% of the Vietnam Mekong Delta (figure 1).Soils are characterized by high Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations and low pH 2.7 to \n3.5, >0.5 mol Fe2+ and 0.05 mol Al3+ m–3.A large portion of these soils are under-water annually for several months during the monsoon season.Sea level rise, sea -\nsonal and increasingly variable cyclones, coastal storms, and high tides flood coastal regions and push seawater upriver mix-ing with fresh water.The onset of the dry season is accompanied by receding waters and shifting salinity concentrations in the waterways with sluice gates and dyke sys-tems built to irrigate and drain the interior landscape and control salinity intrusion.Drought periods can exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables as freshwater flow rates decrease and allow saline water to move further inland (Tully et al.2019).Saltwater intrusion, the land-ward movement of saltwater, alters soil geochemistry and changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', '86A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4security and rural livelihoods (World Bank \n2022;

Widening the adoption of diversified cropping systems and landscape and farm level management practices that are better adapted to acid sulfate soils and increasing salinization.2. Increasing research, field evaluations, and applications on soil microorganisms and the role of organic residue management, and improving plant genetic diversity to mitigate and increase crop tolerance to saline acid sulfate soils and saltwater.3. Increasing freshwater flows and aquifer recharge to offset saltwater intrusion.4. Proactively preparing and protecting lands and settlements to increase resilience against tropical cyclones, drought-flooding extremes, and soil, coastal, and riverbank erosion.5. Managing pesticide and fertilizer use to meet crop nutrient needs while simultaneously reducing and eliminating pesticide and fertilizer contamination of soil, ditches, canals, and rivers.6. Restoring and maintaining wetlands and mangrove forests as multibenefit resources.7. Enabling delta farmers and fishers to make a living that supports their households.8. Restricting new development in eco-sensitive and fragile environmental regions, and strengthening and enforcing land use regulations. Additionally, the report emphasizes the importance of continuous research and experimentation to respond and prepare for present and future uncertainties.

"""What factors influence the height of the constructed raised beds in the Mekong Delta, and how does this impact the soil's salinity and the growth of crops?"""	The height of the constructed raised beds in the Mekong Delta is influenced by several factors including the depth to the acid sulfate horizon, the depth to the water table during the growing season, the role of capillary rise, the specific crop being grown, and the time and cost of labor. The height of these beds plays a significant role in managing soil salinity and crop growth. A higher raised bed creates a thicker zone of leaching and increases the distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, which in turn increases the available soil volume for roots. This can help to mitigate the effects of salinity on the crops. Additionally, evapotranspiration during the dry season can pull water upwards, potentially leaving behind salts such as Na2SO4.

What is the process and purpose of flushing raised beds with fresh water in the context of managing salinity and acid sulfate soils in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam?	Flushing raised beds with fresh water, which is low in electrical conductivity and dissolved metals, is a process used to manage salinity and acid sulfate soils in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. This is done two or three times before a crop is planted. The purpose of this process is to remove or leach soluble substances such as Al, Fe, and SO4 from the surface of the soil clods into the drainage or irrigation ditch. This helps to remove additional toxic substances that can affect crop roots and plant development. Throughout the season, rain and/or freshwater irrigation consolidates and crusts over the soil surface in the raised bed, and mesopores form as crop roots grow and decay. This reduces the number of water-conducting macropores and slows the movement of water through the soil profile, reducing Al leaching. Dry intervals increase Al3+ concentrations in the soil, with infiltration after each precipitation event removing some salts but at slower rates. When fresh water removes the Al from the soil, it concentrates in the outflow to the ditch and can increase contamination in irrigation water downstream.

Flushing raised beds with fresh water (water low in electrical conductivity and dissolved metals) two or three times before a crop is planted removes additional toxic substances that can affect crop roots and plant develop -\nment. Soil Al, Fe, and SO\n42– concentrations \nare flushed with fresh water in annual raised bed systems that are submerged during normal flooding and then planted after the flooding recedes. The raised bed is rebuilt with topsoil after each monsoon flooding, then an annual crop is transplanted into the bed to grow; harvest occurs during the dry season with the cycle annually repeated (Minh et al. 1997a)\n Throughout the season, rain and/\nor freshwater irrigation consolidates and crusts over the soil surface in the raised bed, and mesopores form as crop roots grow and decay. This reduces the num-ber of water-conducting macropores and slows the movement of water through the soil profile reducing Al leaching (figure 5). Dry intervals increase Al\n3+ concentrations \nin the soil with infiltration after each pre -\ncipitation event removing some salts but at slower rates. When fresh water removes the Al from the soil it concentrates in the outflow to the ditch and can increase con -\ntamination in irrigation water downstream (Minh et al.1997a). Multiple-year, perennial raised beds with \ndeeper roots are built higher than annual beds (figure 3). Constructed from topsoil and sulfuric horizon soils while deepening ditches and clearing sediments during the dry season, the beds are left fallow during the following rainy season, flushing out Al and other salt concentrations. The use of the sulfuric horizon soil brings higher concen -trations of Al and SO\n42– to the raised bed \nand lowers the pH. After year 1 planting, development, bloom, fruiting, and harvest, the soil on the raised beds are not disturbed, and a perennial crop is grown on the raised bed for several years.

What are some of the crops that can tolerate high salinity and low pH levels in the acid sulfate soils of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	Aluminum-tolerant crops such as the pineapple cultivar (Ananas comosus [L.] Merrill) can tolerate high salinity and low pH levels in the acid sulfate soils of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. This perennial fruit tolerates low pH and high levels of soluble soil aluminum, grows well in low soil fertility, and is fairly well adapted to acid sulfate soils. Other crops that can tolerate these conditions include Al-tolerant mango (Mangifera indica L.) and salt-tolerant coconut (Cocos nucifera L.). These crops are diversifying the current cropping systems in the delta soils of the region.

Pineapple roots are shallow, spread -\ning laterally 1 to 1.5 m (3.3 to 4.9 ft) and 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) deep, making it well suited for deep-ditch raised bed man-agement (figure 6) (Minh et al 1997b, Nga and van Meenvoort 1997). Pineapple has benefited from efforts to select plants with the ability to exclude Al from entering the root apex and root hairs (Le Van and Masuda 2004). Root elongation and color are two practical plant response indicators of Al toxicity that are useful to farmers in regulating field drainage in acid sulfate soils (Hanhart et al. 1997; LeVan and Masuda 2004). Saline-tolerant fruit culture (Loc et al. 2021), including Al-tolerant mango (Mangifera indica L.) and pineapple cultivars and salt-tolerant coconut ( Cocos nucifera L.) \ncrops, in delta soils are diversifying current cropping systems. \nMICROBIOLOGY OF ACID  \nSULFATE SOILS \nThe relationships among soil organic mat-ter (SOM), pH, microbial activity, and alternating aerobic-anerobic soil condi -tions are important areas of research for future crop adaptation. \nSulfate, a major component of sea -\nwater is reduced to sulfide (S\n2–) by \nmicrobial activity. Sulfide inhibits nitri -\nfication and denitrification (Tully et al. 2019). Soil microbes raise soil pH, drive SO\n42– reduction, break down plant resi -\ndues, and serve as an additional buffer to prevent acidification when the soil dries (Mosley et al. 2017). \nOrganic matter accumulates in fre -\nquently saturated soils with slower decomposition rates than when exposed to air (Tully et al. 2019). The presence of SOM regulates concentrations of Al by retaining the ions and reducing leaching (Nga and van Meenvoort 1997). SOM is the fuel that feeds microbial activity (and SO\n42– reduc-\ntion). When SOM availability is limited, soil microbial action slows or decreases. \nLow pH and metal toxicities inhibit \nplant growth, change the soil structure, affect the diversity of microorganisms, and impact plant available nitrogen (N), phos-phorus (P), and other nutrients.

What are the benefits of using purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) as a biofertilizer in improving plant growth and soil health in the acid sulfate soils of the Mekong Delta?	Purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) have been found to increase phosphorus availability for plant use. They release organic acids during microbial metabolism processes, which increases soil pH and solubilizes Al-P and Fe-P compounds, making phosphorus available for root growth, leaf and flowering, and fruit development. This has shown to improve the growth, yields, and soil health of mango, pineapple, and rice. PNSB solubilizing microbes are active in both aerobic and anerobic environments, making them well suited to the delta’s wet-dry cycles. The use of PNSB also reduces soil legacy phosphorus, improves fertilizer efficiency, and offers an alternative to synthetic fertilizers, potentially reducing the negative impacts of phosphorus loss on water quality.	['90A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4pest and disease resilience (Huu et al.2022; \nNguyen et al.2023).Phosphorus is insoluble (Fe-P) when \nsoil pH is less than 4.However, P solu-bilizing bacteria release organic acids during the microbial metabolism processes and increase soil pH.Evaluations of sev -\neral strains of purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) in the 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) layer of acid sulfate soil have shown that applica -\ntion of R. sphaeroides P solubilizing strains \nincreased P availability for plant use (Luu et al.2022).These bacteria solubilize Al-P and Fe-P compounds, making P avail -\nable for root growth, leaf and flowering, and fruit development.Mango, pineapple, and rice growth, yields, and soil health have shown improvements from the use of PNSB as a biofertilizer.PNSB solubilizing microbes are active in both aerobic and anerobic environments, making them well suited to the delta’s wet-dry cycles.Use of PNSB reduced soil legacy P , improved fer-tilizer efficiency, and offers an alternative to synthetic fertilizers with potential to reduce negative impacts of P loss on water quality (Luu et al.2022).Mekong Delta research on microbial \nbiopesticides for vegetable crops has shown capacity to improve pest, disease, and yield in green onions ( Allium) and an increase in soil \npH after two consecutive crops compared to the control (Nguyen et al.2023).A five-spice biopesticide product of garlic ( Allium sativum  \nL.), chili ( Capsicum), ginger ( Zingiber offici -\nnale), onion, and lemongrass ( Cymbopogon) \nresulted in significant increase in the number of soil bacteria such as beneficial N-fixing bacteria, phosphate (PO\n43–)-solubilizing bac -\nteria, and Si-solubilizing bacteria compared to the control.Stroud and Manefield (2014) found that \nActinobacteria was a major component of acid sulfate soil horizons in Australia.All soil horizons contained d-proteobacteria and a-proteobacteria.Splitting the phylum Chloroflexi into classes revealed that the Chloroflexi class was a dominate group in the acid sulfate soils, and the phy -\nlum Acidobacteria in soil horizons was dominated by Holophagae.The phylum Firmicutes was dominated by the classes Bacilli and Clostridia across all the acid sulfate soils, with the class Nitrospira low in abundance.This is the group that con-tains acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (Leptospirillum sp.), the most important \nphylotype in acid sulfate soils.The abun-dance of this group may be determined by pH due to their limited metabolic capacity (derives energy solely from Fe(II) oxida -\ntion) and adaptability under extremely acidic environments (pH < 4).Although little is known about acid-\ntolerant Fe(II) oxidizers, around 22 are acidophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing species across four phyla (Bonnefoy and Holmes 2012) with only Firmicutes, and Alicyclobacillus detected in these soils.Chloroflexus was \nhighly abundant in the acid sulfate soil horizons, but its role in Fe cycling is not well understood.However, research from microbial mat zones indicated a positive relationship to zones of enriched Fe(II) oxi -\ndation and the fully sequenced Chloroflexus aurantiacus (Trouwborst et al.2007).More research is needed to understand acid sul -\nfate microorganisms and roles they play in regulating plant nutrient uptake.IMPROVING PLANT SALINITY AND \nALUMINUM TOLERANCE \nSaline and freshwater wetland soils accu -\nmulate plant residues in the soil surface horizon and have a permanently sub-merged reduced gleyed horizon where Fe sulfide minerals (FeS\n2) are present \n(Ponnamperuma 1972).These anaerobic, submerged soils are neutral and can sup -\nport salt-tolerant plants.', '89A\nJULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL. 78, NO. 4 JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATIONAluminum-tolerant crops like pineap-\nple cultivar (Ananas comosus  [L.] Merrill), \na perennial fruit, tolerate low pH and high \nlevels of soluble soil Al, grow well in low soil fertility, and are fairly well adapted to acid sulfate soils ( Le Van and Masuda 2004).

What are some of the effects of high salt concentrations on plant growth and how can increasing plant available Silicon improve the salt tolerance of crops in saline soils?	High salt concentrations can have several detrimental effects on plant growth. They can exceed the osmotic pressure in plant cells, leading to a decreased root capacity to absorb minerals like calcium and potassium, as well as water. This can restrict soil water absorption and inhibit seed germination. High salt concentrations can also disturb the sodium/calcium ratio, cause nutrition imbalance, and induce oxidation stress, which can decrease photosynthesis and overall plant productivity.Increasing the availability of silicon (Si) to plants can improve their salt tolerance, particularly in crops like rice, tomatoes, and sugarcane grown in saline soils. Solubilized Si can adjust water uptake by roots, enabling plants to maintain water balance and improve drought tolerance. It can also enhance salt tolerance in some crops by improving seed access to soil water, the structure of leaf cells, and photosynthetic activity. Certain microorganisms can increase soluble Si, which has been found to significantly enhance salt tolerance in some crops. For example, a study on rice cultivars grown in salt-affected soil found that silicate-solubilizing bacteria improved the rice's salt-tolerant capability, growth, and yield.	['However, upland plants have a greater variance in their resis -\ntance to saturated soils and waterlogging.This resistance has been linked to root capacity to oxidize the rhizosphere and ability to withstand short periods of soil submergence (Ponnamperuma 1972).When soil salt solution exceeds the \nosmotic pressure in plant cells, the plant has decreased root capacity to absorb min-erals like Ca, potassium (K), and water.High salt concentrations restrict soil water absorption and inhibit seed germination (Adil et al.2023).Salinity stress on plant metabolic pro-\ncesses affect osmotic processes, specific ion toxicity by disturbing the sodium (Na\n+)/\nCa2+ ratio, nutrition imbalance, and oxi -\ndation stress, which lead to decreased photosynthesis and plant productivity (Adil et al.2023).Increasing plant avail -able Si has been found to improve the salt tolerance of some crops such as rice, tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and sugarcane (Saccharum) grown in saline soils.A growing body of microbial research on Si applications is finding a small increase in soluble Si by specific microorganisms can significantly enhance salt tolerance in some crops including improved seed access to soil water, structure of leaf cells, and photosynthetic activity.Solubilized Si helps adjust water uptake by roots enabling plants to maintain water bal-ance and improve drought tolerance.One silicate-solubilizing bacteria (SSB) study on rice cultivars grown in salt-affected soil under greenhouse conditions in two consecutive seasons evaluated the efficacy of five SSB, Ochrobactrum ciceri TCM_39 (TCM_39), Microbacterium neimengense \nMCM_15 (MCM_15), Klebsiella aerogenes LCT_01 (LCT_01), Citrobacter freundii \nRTTV_12 (RTTV_12), and Olivibacter jilunii PTST_30 (PTST_30), isolated from \nbamboo, sugarcane, rice planted soils, earthworm intestine, and earthworm feces as bacterial sources (Nguyen and Tran 2023).Researchers found SSB improved rice salt-tolerant capability, growth, and yield when grown in salt-affected soils.Biochemical and physiological research \nevaluating salt and Al tolerance in pineapple cultivars is finding significant differences in detection of Al in the soil and accumu -\nlation of Al in roots among cultivars (Le Van and Masuda 2004).Low Al accumula -\ntion in roots accompanied by increased Al tolerance suggests an Al exclusion mecha -\nnism in the roots triggered by exposure to soil Al (LeVan and Masuda 2004).This type of research lays the groundwork for \nimproved plant breeding and technolo -\ngies that target development of plants with root systems able to exclude Al and mini-mize salt impacts on plant water uptake.These are the kind of innovations that \nwill be needed to simultaneously manage water-soil relationships in acid sulfate soils, improve agricultural capacities to pro-duce food and nutrition, enable farmers to make a living, and ensure the integrity of unique delta ecosystems.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation', 'The depth to the acid sulfate hori -\nzon, depth to water table during growing season, the role of capillary rise, the spe -\ncific crop grown, and the time and cost of labor influence the height of the con -\nstructed raised beds.Evapotranspiration will pull water upwards during the dry season, potentially leaving behind Na\n2SO4 \nand other salts.The higher the raised bed, the thicker the zone of leaching will be and distance to the water table and sulfidic materials, thus increasing the available soil volume for roots.Freshly excavated soil deposited as \nridges or shaped into raised beds create a network of macropores between soil clods that enable water to flow through the top -\nsoil and bypass the unsaturated soil matrix.Water moving through the macropores of newly constructed raised beds can quickly Figure 2\nThis sluice gate in Soc Trang Province, Vietnam, connects a main canal to the \nSouth China Sea and controls saltwater tidal inflow and flooding outflow.Open sluice gates allow fields to drain after heavy rains and flooding and are closed during high tide to prevent saltwater from moving into canals and waterways used to irrigate agricultural fields.Copyright © 2023 Soil and Water Conservation Society.All rights reserved.www.swcs.org  78(4):85A-92A Journal of Soil and Water Conservation']

and\n8. r estrict new development in eco-\nsensitive and fragile environmental regions, and strengthen and enforce land use regulations.CONCLUSION: UNCERTAINTY \nADAPTATION \nThe 1980s “rice first” policy promoted engineered ditches, canals, and sluice gates that provided freshwater irrigation, managed flooding, eliminated saltwater intrusion and drained acid sulfate soils to reclaim thousands of hectares for the intensification of rice production (Olson and Morton 2018; Ngan et al.2018; Luu et al.2022).While Vietnamese Mekong Delta farmers have learned over the decades to manage flood-drought cycles in acid sulfate soils, the increasing instability in global cli-mate and local weather conditions present new levels of uncertainty and adaptation challenges.The repeated rapid oxidation of sulfidic materials in acid sulfate soils when exposed to air from drainage, drought, and resubmergence during flooding increases soil acidity, slows soil microbial respiration, increases FeS\n2 buildup leading to reduced \nagriculture productivity, degrades surface water quality, and makes aquatic ecosys -\ntems vulnerable (Tully et al.2019; Mosley et al.2017).A changing climate has altered the \npredicable delta wet-dry seasonal regimes and made it more difficult for farmers to grow traditional rice crops.Climate change, sea level rise, human land use management, increased population, and the rise in food and nutrition insecurity is again challenging the region to ratchet up their adaptation and agricultural pro -\nduction strategies to ensure food and nutrition security, ecosystem well-being, and that Vietnamese farmers are able to make a living.Local and indigenous farmer knowl-\nedge and university scientific research have combined to create innovative land man-agement approaches, engineer extensive water management projects, and develop salt-tolerant crop varieties to make acid sulfate soils agriculturally productive.Continuous research and experimentation will be needed to respond and prepare for present and future uncertainties.Adaptive integration of biogeophysical, \npedogenic, and social knowledge is critical in deepening understanding of landscape and local surface level drainage impacts and soil-water relationships under increas -\ningly variable conditions.Observing and learning more about the connections and synergies among rates of percolation, soil management effects on macropores and mesopores, the role of bypass flows in raised bed soil leaching processes, densities and types of beneficial bacteria in pro-ductive soils, and plant breeding for salt tolerance will be essential to living with uncertainty and strengthening delta sus -\ntainability and resilience.', '86A\nJOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION JULY/AUGUST 2023 —VOL.78, NO.4security and rural livelihoods (World Bank \n2022;

Luu et al.2022).At first natural waterways were straight-\nened and deepened, and then connected by canals.The French Colonial Government set about clearing forests and draining wetlands to turn the underutilized and agriculturally unproductive soils into rice production.These sparsely populated, densely vegetated acid sulfate lands were used by resistance fighters as hideouts dur -\ning the US Vietnam War (1961 to 1973).After the war, the Vietnam state established large-scale state farms (1,000 to 10,000 ha [2,471 to 24,710 ac]) to increase the delta population and alleviate serious food shortages (van Mensvoort 1996).Newly resettled farmers were inexperienced in managing waterlogged acid sulfate soils to make them productive, and the state farms were inadequately funded with a shortage of knowledge and equipment resources as well as insufficient farm workers for large-scale parcels.Excess water on the landscape in monsoon season alternating with dry season freshwater scarcity made delta living conditions harsh, and most of these collective farms failed to grow enough food for farmers to make a living (van Mensvoort 1996).By the mid-1980s irrigation projects \nexpanded throughout the delta to create a freshwater network across the entire pen-insula with sluice gates that protected the waterway grid from saline intrusion and reengineered the waterscape to drain and control water for rice agriculture (Taylor 2014).Rice establishes and grows well in waterlogged environments but is sensitive to salinity with an electric conductivity (EC\nSPE) threshold of 3 dS m–1 (Korres et \nal.2022).The saline delta rivers, wetlands, and marshes were converted into peren-nial freshwater zones.This reduced the seasonal variation in water flow patterns, converted the flood plain into regulated canals, dykes, and polders that irrigated agriculture, and prevented annual flood waters from submerging fields (and sedi -\nments from replenishing soil fertility) (Luu et.2022).T oday’s Vietnam Mekong Delta agri -\ncultural landscape is built on managing and controlling the quantity and distri-bution of water year round (flooding, irrigation, fresh and saline waters) in allu -\nvial and acid sulfate soils (figure 2).']
"""What strategies can be used to manage the harmful effects of soil salinity in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, as mentioned in the report?"""	"The report suggests several strategies to manage the harmful effects of soil salinity in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These include modifying the delta floodwater control system to encourage farmers to diversify their cropping systems and be more attentive to the environmental impacts of agriculture. The Vietnam Resolution 120/2017/NQ-CP promotes ""living with floods,"" ""uncertainty adaptation,"" and nature-based approaches for addressing climate change and upstream development. Farmers are encouraged to seek innovative water management and drainage approaches and adapt cropping systems to changing soil-water conditions. Understanding the properties and processes of acid sulfate soils, developing climate-flexible crops and management systems, and increasing crop genetic tolerances to Al and salt concentrations are also foundational to effective delta agricultural adaptation. The report also mentions the transformation of the delta into an agricultural landscape through the construction of canals to channel fresh water from the Mekong and Bassac rivers to reduce water and soil salinity. The use of sluice gates to protect the waterway grid from saline intrusion and to drain and control water for rice agriculture is also highlighted."

What are the implications of saltwater intrusion on the soil chemistry in agricultural fields in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, as discussed in the report?	Saltwater intrusion, which is the landward movement of saltwater, can significantly alter the soil geochemistry in agricultural fields in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. This intrusion changes soil porewater chemistry, soil pH, and other characteristics. It can also exacerbate saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater tables during drought periods, as freshwater flow rates decrease and allow saline water to move further inland. This can lead to increased salt concentrations in the soil, which can affect the productivity of agricultural lands.

"""What methods were used in the study to determine the impact of salinity intrusion on the productivity of crops in the Mekong Delta region?"""	The study used panel data collected from the Statistical Yearbook for the period 2010 – 2019. This data included information on yield and area of rice, maize, sweet potato; salinity, river water level, average temperature, precipitation and total hours of sunshine. To analyze this data, multiple regression models were employed.

"""How does the increase in salinity concentration affect the productivity of crops such as rice and sweet potatoes in the Mekong Delta?"""	An increase in salinity concentration negatively impacts the productivity of crops such as rice and sweet potatoes in the Mekong Delta. Specifically, when salinity increases by 1 gram per liter, it reduces the yield of rice by 0.197 quintal per hectare and sweet potato by 2.809 quintals per hectare. Furthermore, the yield of these crops also depends on the lowest river water levels or severe water shortages in the dry season, which further reduce crop yields.

"""How does the increase in river water level affect the yield of rice and corn in the Mekong Delta, according to the study by Nguyễn ị Mỹ Hạnh and colleagues?"""	When the highest river water level increases by 1 cm, the yield of rice increases by 0.013 tons per hectare and the yield of corn increases by 0.14 tons per hectare. Conversely, an increase of 1 cm in the lowest river water level results in a decrease in rice yield by 0.024 tons per hectare. This is because the Mekong Delta is a key area for rice cultivation, and a too low river water level can lead to a lack of irrigation water for crops.

What are some alternative crops and management practices that can be used in the Mekong River Delta to mitigate the effects of saline intrusion and provide income opportunities for farmers?	Alternative crops that can be used in the Mekong River Delta to mitigate the effects of saline intrusion include familiar crops like maize and soybean, as well as novel crops such as quinoa and cowpea. These crops were identified based on factors such as salt tolerance, efficiency of water use, ability to grow in the dry season, tolerance to pests and diseases, labor intensiveness, and marketability. In terms of management practices, techniques like mulching and soil moisture monitoring can be employed. Mulching with organic materials or plastic coverings can help maintain soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and decrease the concentration of surface salt. Soil moisture monitoring, on the other hand, can assist in developing an effective irrigation schedule that improves water use efficiency and minimizes the amount of saline water applied. These practices can help reduce salinity stress, improve water use efficiency, and provide farmers with production options for saline affected areas during the dry season.

Dong et al., 2008 ), however this is not an issue in the MRD.The \nmajority of plastic mulches are polyethylene based and non- \nbiodegradable, thus the environmental implications of using plastic \nmulch must be carefully considered (Kasirajan and Ngouajio, 2012 ).Research into biodegradable plastic mulches and microorganisms that \ndecompose plastic is still developing (Shah and Wu, 2020 ).4.1.2.Soil moisture monitoring \nFlooded rice production has dominated the MRD and thus there is a \nlack of knowledge regarding irrigation schedules for upland crops.Monitoring soil moisture throughout the dry season can help producers \ndevelop an irrigation schedule that will improve WUE and minimise the \namount of saline water applied.Tensiometers can be an effective tool to \nmonitor soil moisture and apply irrigation at the required time to \nmaintain adequate soil moisture, although they are not readily available \nto producers in the MRD.Successful monitoring of soil moisture in the \nMRD is dependent on affordable and easy to use devices.The Chameleon \nsoil moisture sensor is a cost-effective device that provides real-time, \nFig.7.A relative suitability scale for assessing a crops suitability as an alternative crop for growth in the MRD dry season using several physiological (salt tolerance, \nwater use (mm), water use efficiency (WUE), growth duration, temperature tolerance (Temp), pest and disease tolerance and socioeconomic factors (use of existing \nmachinery (Machinery) and existing market).Greater emphasis is placed on factors with larger circles.B.

What are the impacts of saline intrusion on agricultural production and farmer livelihoods in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam?	Saline intrusion in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) in Vietnam can have negative impacts on agricultural production, particularly rice, which is a fundamental crop in the region. This can expose the economy of the MRD, as agriculture accounts for approximately 40% of the regional GDP and provides livelihoods for over 75% of the people. The MRD contributes to 56% of the total rice produced in Vietnam and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD population. Therefore, any negative impacts on rice production due to saline intrusion can significantly affect the livelihoods of the people in the MRD.

it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.']
What are the contributing factors to saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta and how do they affect the region?	The contributing factors to saline intrusion in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) include the development of irrigation infrastructure, changes to upstream river flows, a changing climate causing rising sea levels, tidal influxes, and drought. These factors have created a link between the ocean and agricultural regions, making the MRD, which has a marginal elevation above sea level, vulnerable to oceanic saline water intrusion. This intrusion has damaging effects on agricultural production, farmer livelihoods, and economic stability. It has been identified as the most prominent hazard to agricultural production for farming households. Saline intrusion is also causing soil salinisation, impacting rice production and decreasing long-term productive capacity as soil salts accumulate over time. In 2020, parts of the MRD declared emergencies with drought and salinity affecting over 100,000 ha of rice crop production as salt water intruded inland. It is predicted that salt concentrations in 2050 will exceed levels detrimental to rice production up to 60 km upriver from the ocean.	['Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n3rice crops a year.The climate of the region is tropical monsoonal, with \ntwo distinct seasons (Fig.2); 90% of the average rainfall (1860 mm) \noccurs in the rainy season (Dang et al., 2020 ).The timings shown in \nFig.2 are typical for the MRD, however they may vary between different \nparts of the region.2.Saline intrusion \nWhile the development of irrigation infrastructure in the 1970 ’s \n(Wassmann et al., 2004 ; Van Kien et al., 2020 ) allowed for the intensi -\nfication of rice production (Nguyen et al., 2020b ), it also created a link \nbetween the ocean and agricultural regions.Because the MRD has a \nmarginal elevation above sea level, it is vulnerable to oceanic saline \nwater intrusion.This is exacerbated by changes to upstream river flows \nand a changing climate causing rising sea levels, tidal influxes, and \ndrought (Wassmann et al., 2004 ; Trieu and Phong, 2015 ; Hoa et al., \n2019 ).The contributing factors to dry season saline intrusion and the \nassociated effects these have on the MRD are highlighted in Table 1.Salinity has been identified as the most prominent hazard to agri-\ncultural production for farming households (Renaud et al., 2015 ) with \nnational authorities suggesting the irrigation threshold for salinity \nregarded as being detrimental to rice production is 4 g L\x001 (Le et al., \n2007 ).Saline intrusion has damaging effects on agricultural production, \nfarmer livelihoods and economic stability (Phung et al., 2020 ).In 2000, \nthe Vietnamese government recognised the need to diversify agricul -\ntural production in order to meet food security demands and thus \nchanges were made to the land use policy (Nguyen et al., 2020c ).This \nallowed for the diversification into rice shrimp farming along coastal \nareas that utilised saline water and provided high economic returns, \nhowever at the adverse cost of rapid soil salinisation.Over 1.2 million ha \nof the southernmost point of the MRD is now classified as salt affected as \na result of rice shrimp farming (Thi Nhung et al., 2019 ).Increasingly \nworrisome is evidence of saline intrusion occurring in inland provinces \nfurther up the Mekong traditionally not affected by salinity (Fig.3) \n(Phung et al., 2020 ).Despite the installation of over 21,000 sluice gates \nalong the 92,000 km of canals of the MRD (Marchand et al., 2011 ), sa-\nline water is impacting rice production and decreasing long-term pro-\nductive capacity as soil salts accumulate over time (Renaud et al., 2015 ).In 2020, parts of the MRD including Soc Trang and Tra Vinh Provinces \ndeclared emergencies with drought and salinity affecting over 100,000 \nha of rice crop production as salt water intruded ~60 –70 km inland (MARD, 2020 ).The extent of saline intrusion over time is summarised in Fig.4 where \nintrusion occurred prior to sluice gate control (1998), was constrained to \ncoastal areas in 2010, however breached sluice gate control measures in \n2016 and 2020 and intruded far into inland provinces affecting over 2 \nmillion ha (Loc et al., 2021 ).It has been predicted that salt concentra -\ntions in 2050 will exceed 4 g L\x001 up to 60 km upriver from the ocean (Vu \net al., 2018 ), meaning that inland areas like Can Tho will be subjected to \nthe same severe salinisation currently observed in coastal areas.In response to inland saline intrusion, farmers have varied the time of \nsowing based on seasonal predictions (Phung et al., 2020 ) in an effort to \nadvance crop development and avoid salinity damage at the critical \nstages of anthesis and grain filling (Fig.4).Efforts have also been made \nFig.2.The three phase (He Thu, Thu Dong and Dong Xuan) rice cropping calendar of the Mekong River Delta.Also shown are the months of the rainy and \ndry seasons.Table 1 \nThe contributing factors causing dry season saline intrusion and the conse -\nquential effects on the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam.', 'Nguyen, B., Hay, N., Due, L.A., Hung, B.N., 2016.Viet Nam agricultural machinery \nindustry.AMA, Agricult.Mech.Asia, Africa nd Latin America 47, 67–70.Nguyen, B., Nguyen, V., Lanh, N., Bui, T.-A., 2020a.Mekong River Delta agricultural \nmechanization development: case study in Vinh Long Province, Viet Nam.Int.J. \nAdv.Sci.Eng.Inform.Technol.10, 736.Nguyen, K., Nguyen, H., Cramb, R., 2020b.Trends in Rice-Based Farming Systems in the \nMekong Delta .Nguyen, Q.H., Tran, D.D., Dang, K.K., Korbee, D., Pham, L.D.M.H., Vu, L.T., Luu, T.T., \nHo, L.H., Nguyen, P.T., Ngo, T., Nguyen, D.T.K., Wyatt, A., Van Aalst, M., Tran, T.A., \nSea, W.B., 2020c.Land-use dynamics in the Mekong delta: from national policy to \nlivelihood sustainability.Sustain.Dev.28, 448–467.Otsuka, K., Fan, S., 2001.Agricultural Development: New Perspectives in a Changing \nWorld.Washington International Food Policy Research Institute .Oumarou, H., Falalou, H., Taya, B., Mahamane, S., Vadez, V., 2015.Water use, \ntranspiration efficiency and yield in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and peanut \n(Arachis hypogaea) across water regimes.Crop Pasture Sci.66.Oveisi, M., 2017.Cardinal temperatures for seed germination of three quinoa \n(Chenopodium quinoa Willd.)cultivars.Iran.J.

What measures have been suggested to farmers in the Mekong River Delta to mitigate the effects of saline intrusion on rice crops, and what are the potential alternative crops that could be grown in this region?	Several measures have been suggested to farmers in the Mekong River Delta to mitigate the effects of saline intrusion on rice crops. These include management practices such as mulching, creating raised beds, and monitoring soil water. These practices can decrease salinity stress and improve water use efficiency. In terms of alternative crops, familiar crops like maize and soybean, as well as novel crops to the region like quinoa and cowpea, have been explored as potential options to replace dry season rice. The success of these alternative crops depends on factors such as salt tolerance, timing and efficiency of water use, ability to grow in the dry season, tolerance to pests and diseases, labor intensiveness, and marketability.

What are some alternative crops that have shown tolerance to high salinity levels, which is a growing issue in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam?	Some alternative crops that have shown tolerance to high salinity levels include cowpea, quinoa, mustard greens, and maize. Cowpea appears to osmotically adjust by accumulating greater concentrations of Na+ in their roots during vegetative stages to minimise salinity damage. Quinoa, due to its halophytic nature, can withstand high levels of salinity and has shown to have increased biomass and yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline conditions. Mustard greens have shown an overexpression of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) associated with an increased sequestration of Na+ in roots. Maize plants have been found to have increased concentrations of proline, an osmoprotectant that plays a critical role in counteracting osmotic stress, under salt-stressed conditions.	['Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n5season with canal water salt concentrations exceeding the 4 g L\x001 rice \nproducing threshold in lower elevations of the delta (Phung et al., 2020 ), \nsometimes reaching ~15 g L\x001 towards the end of the dry season (Eslami \net al., 2019 ).Rice will start to incur yield losses at 2 g L\x001 (Grattan et al., \n2002 ) and even salt tolerant varieties will suffer grain quality defects at \n3 to 4 g L\x001 (Qin et al., 2020 ).Consequently, plants that can either \ntolerate salinity during the reproductive stages of growth, or plants that \ncan be harvested early will be more suitable as alternative crops.Are there prospective salt tolerant crops for the MRD?Field trials of \npossible crops are just starting, but there are promising and notable \nalternative crops of whom demonstrate various cellular physiological \nmechanisms for tolerating salinity exposure.Salt-tolerant varieties of \ncowpea (Vigna unguiculata ) appear to osmotically adjust by accumu -\nlating greater concentrations of Na+in their roots during vegetative \nstages to minimise salinity damage (Le et al., 2021 ).The upregulated \nproduction of proteins involved in photorespiratory pathways also oc-\ncurs in cowpea plants exposed to salinity (De Abreu et al., 2014 ).Quinoa \n(Chenopodium quinoa) can withstand high levels of salinity due to its \nhalophytic nature and efficiency in excluding Na+from its leaves (Cai \nand Gao, 2020 ).In fact, quinoa has shown to have increased biomass \nand yield production under saline conditions compared to non-saline \nconditions (Hariadi et al., 2011 ; Jacobsen et al., 2003 ).Characterisa -\ntion of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) involved in salt sensory \nmechanisms has occurred in quinoa (Maughan et al., 2009 ) with the \nplant demonstrating the ability to rapidly sequester salt into the vacuole \nto prevent the accumulation of cytoplasmic Na+(Cai and Gao, 2020 ).An \noverexpression of the SOS1 gene was also found in saline tolerant \nmustard greens (Brassica juncea) that was associated with an increased sequestration of Na+in roots (Singh et al., 2019 ).Proline is an osmo -\nprotectant that plays a critical role in counteracting osmotic stress and \nincreased concentrations of proline have been found in salt-stressed \nmaize (Zea mays) plants (Kaya et al., 2010 ).Whilst alternative crops have differing cellular physiological salt \ntolerance mechanisms, salinity also affects the agronomy and conse -\nquential yield in different ways.Seedlings are generally sensitive to salt \nexposure; however, seedlings of alternative crops are planted when soil \nsalinity levels are low.For this review, germination and seedling toler-\nance is irrelevant and will not be further investigated.Priority lays with \nan alternative crops ability to withstand salinity exposure during vege-\ntative and reproductive growth.Ultimately, the precedence is a crops \nability to produce marketable yield in a saline environment.Table 2 \nsummarises the yield response of alternative crop options at varying salt \nconcentrations including a relative ranking.Quinoa proves very salt tolerant and successfully produces grain \n(Hussain et al., 2020 ) at similar concentrations recorded in canals dur-\ning extreme salinisation events in the MRD (Eslami et al., 2019 ), whilst \ncowpea and mustard greens demonstrate high tolerance.The successful \ninoculation of cowpea played a significant role in the crops ability to \nwithstand increased salt concentrations (Manaf and Zayed, 2015 ).The \nreproductive phases of maize are affected by salinity with decreased \nkernel set and grain weight (Kaya et al., 2010 ) and consequentially, is \nranked lower than cowpea and mustard greens.Soybean has a low \ntolerance and ranks similarly to rice, although salt-tolerant soybean \nvarieties can increase photosynthetic rates to generate ~47% greater \ngrain yields than salt-sensitive varieties (He et al., 2016 ).', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n2Numerous biophysical, environmental, and \nsocioeconomic factors are identified that help \ndetermine an alternative crops suitability \nManagement practices including mulching, \nraised beds and soil water monitoring can \ndecrease salinity stress and improve water use \nefficiency \nCombining alternative crops and management \npractices provide farmers with production \noptions for saline affected areas during the dry \nseason RESULTS: Familiar crops in Vietnam (e.g., maize, soybean), as well as novel crops to the MRD (e.g., quinoa, \ncowpea) were explored as potential options to replace dry season rice.Management options including surface soil \nmulches and plastic coverings help maintain soil moisture and reduce salinity damage to plants, and the use of \ndrainage and seed preparation techniques can improve plant establishment and yield.Factors contributing to the \nsuccess of alternative crops include salt tolerance, timing and efficiency of water use, ability to grow in the dry \ngrowing season, tolerance to pests and diseases, labour intensiveness and the crops ’ marketability.SIGNIFICANCE: The identification of suitable alternative crops to replace dry season rice in saline affected areas \nof the MRD, combined with management practices like mulching and soil moisture monitoring, could provide \nfarmers with income opportunities to offset rice losses.Documenting the factors contributing to successful crop \ndiversification can assist with decision-making and support initiatives among farmers, agribusiness, and gov-\nernment agencies.1.Introduction: The Mekong River Delta and the central role of \nrice cropping \nThis review focuses on the increasing salinisation of the Mekong \nDelta in Vietnam and the search for alternative crops to rice.Focusing on \nthe primary bio-physical aspects, the review has sections on: the Mekong \nRiver Delta and the central role of rice cropping, saline intrusion, \nalternative crops to rice, and in-field management practices to mitigate \nthe impacts of saline intrusion.The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is in the south of Vietnam where the \nMekong River flows through a network of distributaries before reaching \nthe East Sea (Fig.1).The Mekong is the longest river in Southeast Asia \nand originates in the Tibetan Plateau before flowing through China, \nMyanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam;

What crops have been identified as having high water use efficiency and are therefore more suited for growth in the Mekong River Delta during the dry season when there is minimal rainfall and increased salinity intrusion?	Crops such as maize, soybean, quinoa, and cowpea have been identified as potential alternatives to rice in the Mekong River Delta during the dry season. These crops have been explored for their high water use efficiency and their ability to grow under conditions of minimal rainfall and increased salinity intrusion. However, it's important to note that the higher water requirement of maize and soybean may limit their suitability for larger scale growth as an alternative to rice. Quinoa, on the other hand, is highly drought resistant with a low water requirement and has been successfully grown in conditions similar to the MRD dry season. Cowpea has also been successfully grown in dry season conditions.

alternative crops to rice.Focusing on \nthe primary bio-physical aspects, the review has sections on: the Mekong \nRiver Delta and the central role of rice cropping, saline intrusion, \nalternative crops to rice, and in-field management practices to mitigate \nthe impacts of saline intrusion.The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is in the south of Vietnam where the \nMekong River flows through a network of distributaries before reaching \nthe East Sea (Fig.1).The Mekong is the longest river in Southeast Asia \nand originates in the Tibetan Plateau before flowing through China, \nMyanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam; it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n8ranged from 31 to 44 ◦C (Oumarou et al., 2015 ).Alternative crops with a shorter growing duration like quinoa, \ncowpea and mustard greens that would mature before the peak in \nsalinity occurs may be a more suitable option as a replacement dry \nseason crop.Additionally, tolerance to the high temperatures that occur \nthroughout the dry season is essential for a plant to successfully grow as \nan alternative to rice.3.4.Tolerance to disease and pests \nDisease and pest susceptibility refers to the risk of a plant being likely \nto be affected by diseases or pests.This can have implications for yield \nand profitability and thus an alternative replacement crop for rice \nshould have a relatively low susceptibility.Diseases and pests can often \nbe controlled by integrated pest management (IPM) options involving \neither chemical application or biocontrol methods, although the cost for \nimplementing these must be considered when considering alternative \ncrops.High disease and pest pressures exist in MRD rice systems because of \ncontinuous cropping.Rice blast (Fukuta et al., 2020 ) and brown plant \nhoppers cause extensive damage to rice crops (Phan et al., 2010 ) and \nconsequently, farmers are familiar with the use of chemical control \nmethods.A farmer survey conducted in the MRD identified 64 different \nchemicals that were used in rice-shrimp farming systems (Berg, 2001 ).Of these, 25% were herbicides, 25% fungicides and the remaining 50% \nwere insecticides.The survey also identified a strong understanding and \nimplementation of IPM.Whilst an ideal replacement crop would have \nlow pest and disease pressures, the identification of crops that have well \nestablished knowledge regarding the management and control of \nprominent pest and diseases could also be favoured.Good environmental conditions exist for pathogen growth during the \nrainy season although conditions in the MRD dry season do not favour \nfungal spore development.Despite a lower disease pressure in the dry \nseason, the identification of alternative crops that have undertaken \nadvanced breeding through the selection of disease tolerant traits will \nhelp reduce disease impacts.Fungal diseases like downy mildew, stalk \nrot and sheath blights have been identified as some of the major diseases \nin Vietnamese grown maize (Sharma et al., 1993 ).Downy mildew is a \nprominent fungal disease in quinoa (Testen et al., 2012 ) with consid -\nerable yield losses incurring from infection (Danielsen and Munk, 2004 ).The breeding of downy mildew tolerant quinoa varieties have signifi -\ncantly decreased fungal impacts in these production systems (Colque- \nLittle et al., 2021 ).Soybean is also affected by fungal diseases with up to \n20% yield reductions occurring in plants infected with powdery mildew \n(Dunn and Gaynor, 2020 ) although breeding of tolerant Vietnamese \nsoybean can reduce disease susceptibility (Ho Manh et al., 2016 ).Powdery mildew has also been identified in Vietnamese Indian mustard \ngreens (Tam et al., 2016 ) with evidence of tolerance in Indian cultivars \n(Nanjundan et al., 2020 ), although more work needs to be done to breed \ndisease tolerant varieties in Vietnam.The combination of IPM and use \nvarietal selection may help reduce the losses or costs of production \nincurred from pest and diseases.3.5.Ability to be sown and processed using available labour \nFarm mechanisation has improved over the last decade in the MRD in \nresponse to labour shortages and developments in the availability of \nsmall farm machinery.Mechanisation reduces labour time and improves \nefficiency, however the equipment available to MRD farmers is gener -\nally specific to rice crop production and small farm sizes can hinder \nuptake (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).Ideally, alternative dry season replace -\nment crops would be capable of being grown using the same rice- \nproducing equipment already available to farmers, without major \nmodification, although there will be limits to this.Unlike rice which \nrequires anaerobic soil conditions (Rauf et al., 2019 ), alternative crops \nwill generally require aerobic soil conditions for growth.']
What are some alternative crops to rice that can tolerate the conditions in the Mekong River Delta during the dry season, and what are their specific requirements or sensitivities?	Some alternative crops to rice that can tolerate the conditions in the Mekong River Delta during the dry season include maize, soybean, quinoa, and cowpea. These crops have specific requirements and sensitivities. For instance, they need to have a shorter growing duration to mature before the peak in salinity occurs. They also need to tolerate high temperatures that occur throughout the dry season. Disease and pest susceptibility is another factor to consider, as it can impact yield and profitability. Therefore, an ideal replacement crop should have a relatively low susceptibility to diseases and pests. Furthermore, these crops should be able to be sown and processed using the available labour and machinery, which is generally specific to rice crop production. Unlike rice, which requires anaerobic soil conditions, these alternative crops generally require aerobic soil conditions for growth.

alternative crops to rice.Focusing on \nthe primary bio-physical aspects, the review has sections on: the Mekong \nRiver Delta and the central role of rice cropping, saline intrusion, \nalternative crops to rice, and in-field management practices to mitigate \nthe impacts of saline intrusion.The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is in the south of Vietnam where the \nMekong River flows through a network of distributaries before reaching \nthe East Sea (Fig.1).The Mekong is the longest river in Southeast Asia \nand originates in the Tibetan Plateau before flowing through China, \nMyanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam; it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.', 'Agricultural Systems 207 (2023) 103632\n8ranged from 31 to 44 ◦C (Oumarou et al., 2015 ).Alternative crops with a shorter growing duration like quinoa, \ncowpea and mustard greens that would mature before the peak in \nsalinity occurs may be a more suitable option as a replacement dry \nseason crop.Additionally, tolerance to the high temperatures that occur \nthroughout the dry season is essential for a plant to successfully grow as \nan alternative to rice.3.4.Tolerance to disease and pests \nDisease and pest susceptibility refers to the risk of a plant being likely \nto be affected by diseases or pests.This can have implications for yield \nand profitability and thus an alternative replacement crop for rice \nshould have a relatively low susceptibility.Diseases and pests can often \nbe controlled by integrated pest management (IPM) options involving \neither chemical application or biocontrol methods, although the cost for \nimplementing these must be considered when considering alternative \ncrops.High disease and pest pressures exist in MRD rice systems because of \ncontinuous cropping.Rice blast (Fukuta et al., 2020 ) and brown plant \nhoppers cause extensive damage to rice crops (Phan et al., 2010 ) and \nconsequently, farmers are familiar with the use of chemical control \nmethods.A farmer survey conducted in the MRD identified 64 different \nchemicals that were used in rice-shrimp farming systems (Berg, 2001 ).Of these, 25% were herbicides, 25% fungicides and the remaining 50% \nwere insecticides.The survey also identified a strong understanding and \nimplementation of IPM.Whilst an ideal replacement crop would have \nlow pest and disease pressures, the identification of crops that have well \nestablished knowledge regarding the management and control of \nprominent pest and diseases could also be favoured.Good environmental conditions exist for pathogen growth during the \nrainy season although conditions in the MRD dry season do not favour \nfungal spore development.Despite a lower disease pressure in the dry \nseason, the identification of alternative crops that have undertaken \nadvanced breeding through the selection of disease tolerant traits will \nhelp reduce disease impacts.Fungal diseases like downy mildew, stalk \nrot and sheath blights have been identified as some of the major diseases \nin Vietnamese grown maize (Sharma et al., 1993 ).Downy mildew is a \nprominent fungal disease in quinoa (Testen et al., 2012 ) with consid -\nerable yield losses incurring from infection (Danielsen and Munk, 2004 ).The breeding of downy mildew tolerant quinoa varieties have signifi -\ncantly decreased fungal impacts in these production systems (Colque- \nLittle et al., 2021 ).Soybean is also affected by fungal diseases with up to \n20% yield reductions occurring in plants infected with powdery mildew \n(Dunn and Gaynor, 2020 ) although breeding of tolerant Vietnamese \nsoybean can reduce disease susceptibility (Ho Manh et al., 2016 ).Powdery mildew has also been identified in Vietnamese Indian mustard \ngreens (Tam et al., 2016 ) with evidence of tolerance in Indian cultivars \n(Nanjundan et al., 2020 ), although more work needs to be done to breed \ndisease tolerant varieties in Vietnam.The combination of IPM and use \nvarietal selection may help reduce the losses or costs of production \nincurred from pest and diseases.3.5.Ability to be sown and processed using available labour \nFarm mechanisation has improved over the last decade in the MRD in \nresponse to labour shortages and developments in the availability of \nsmall farm machinery.Mechanisation reduces labour time and improves \nefficiency, however the equipment available to MRD farmers is gener -\nally specific to rice crop production and small farm sizes can hinder \nuptake (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).Ideally, alternative dry season replace -\nment crops would be capable of being grown using the same rice- \nproducing equipment already available to farmers, without major \nmodification, although there will be limits to this.Unlike rice which \nrequires anaerobic soil conditions (Rauf et al., 2019 ), alternative crops \nwill generally require aerobic soil conditions for growth.']
What alternative crops with shorter growing durations and tolerance to high temperatures could potentially replace rice in the dry season in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, to mitigate the effects of salinity intrusion?	Quinoa, cowpea, and mustard greens are potential alternative crops with shorter growing durations and tolerance to high temperatures that could replace rice in the dry season in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. These crops could mature before the peak in salinity occurs, making them more suitable options.

approximately one harvester exists per 50 ha of cropping \nproduction land in the MRD (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).Minor modifications \nto the header front, sieves, fan and rotor speeds to suit each crop can be \nmade to optimise harvest yields.Processing equipment is common on \nfarm including mechanical corn shelling machines (Dang et al., 2004 ) or \ndryers for moist grain (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).Some identified alternative crops including maize (Rashid et al., \n2013 ) and soybean (Ho Manh et al., 2016 ) are already grown in the MRD \nwith farmers aware of the production cycle and labour required.How-\never, the production of other alternative crops in the MRD dry season \nwill be influenced by the successful adaption and use of available \nmechanisation (Nguyen et al., 2020a ).3.6.Profitability and availability of a market chain \nThe production of an alternative dry season crop must be financially \nviable for farmers.The shift from double- to triple-rice production \ninitially improved the profitability of rice monoculture systems in the \nMRD, but required significant increases in inputs, particularly fertilisers \nand pesticides.Over time, as the cost of these inputs has increased, the \nprofit margin of triple-rice production has gradually decreased \n(WorldBank, 2016 ).The cost of pesticides and fertilisers was recently \nestimated at 50–60% of total production costs in the MRD, while the \nprofitability of triple-rice systems relative to double-rice systems had \ndeclined significantly, with total yields in some cases less than in double- \nrice systems (Tran et al., 2018b ).Viability includes having an available market to trade produce.Farmers in the MRD are familiar with identifying new market chains \nwhen adapting to alternative farming practices, as evidenced by the \nimplementation of rice and shrimp farming (Dang, 2020 ).In addition, \nMRD farmers have already established market chains for some alterna -\ntive crops including maize and soybean.In a 2004 survey, farmers re-\nported that large quantities of maize could be sold via traders and \ncollectors from the farm gate which saved on transportation labour and \ncosts (Dang et al., 2004 ).Further opportunities for selling produce at \nvillage markets provides additional income to famers.An absence of \nmarket chain exists for crops like quinoa in the MRD, however the global \nquinoa market is rapidly expanding (Alandia et al., 2020 ) with over 120 \ncountries now growing it (Bazile et al., 2016 ).The identified alternative \ncrops are all directly consumable products for human or livestock and do \nnot require large amounts of processing like a fibre crop.This provides \nMRD farmers with the opportunity to sell directly to traders or con-\nsumers to maximise economic return.Export opportunities also exists, \nbut may require further development of relevant value chains (Otsuka \nand Fan, 2001 ).3.7.Overall suitability \nThe combination of factors discussed above contribute to an overall \nsuitability scale (Fig.7).This relative scale includes rice as a comparison \ncrop and can be used to examine the suitability of a range of different \ncrops not mentioned above or adapted for a different scenario or loca-\ntion.For the purpose of this review, greater emphasis is placed on a \ncrop ’s physiological suitability to the MRD dry season, as without the \nability to tolerate salinity or grow with minimal water, the adaption \nrequired to existing machinery or development of a market cannot \noccur.Using a ‘traffic light ’ framework such as that presented in Fig.']

What are some suitable alternative crops and management practices that can be implemented in the Mekong River Delta to reduce the effects of salinity intrusion and maximize production during the dry season?	Some suitable alternative crops that can be implemented in the Mekong River Delta to reduce the effects of salinity intrusion and maximize production during the dry season include familiar crops like maize and soybean, as well as novel crops such as quinoa and cowpea. These crops were explored as potential options to replace dry season rice. In terms of management practices, techniques like mulching and soil moisture monitoring can be beneficial. Mulching with organic materials or plastic coverings can maintain soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and slow capillary rise, thereby reducing the concentration of surface salt. Soil moisture monitoring can help producers develop an irrigation schedule that will improve water use efficiency and minimize the amount of saline water applied.

What are some of the benefits and potential challenges of using raised beds and drainage systems to reduce soil salinity levels in the Mekong River Delta?	Raised beds and drainage systems can effectively reduce soil salinity levels in the Mekong River Delta. They provide adequate drainage options for waterlogging sensitive plants and can help minimize salinity damage to plants by removing excess saline water. For instance, in Bangladesh, a raised bed system combined with mulch produced about 70% more potato tubers than flat ground with no mulch. Sub-surface drainage is known to remove excess saline water and helps reduce long-term soil salinisation. However, there are potential challenges to consider. The implementation of these systems can be labor-intensive, which could be a deterrent for some farmers. While mechanisation is increasing in popularity in the Mekong River Delta, with a recent farmer survey indicating that one rotary tiller with a walking tractor exists for every 7 hectares of rice produced, the labor and resources required for these systems must still be taken into account.

Ashraf and Foolad, 2005 ).This simple technique has improved \ngermination, plant establishment and plant growth by initiating imbi-\nbition and activating metabolic processes (Ashraf and Foolad, 2005 ).Success across a multitude of crops has been reported with improved \ngermination rates in maize (Ashraf and Rauf, 2001 ), sorghum (Chen \net al., 2021 ) and quinoa (Yang et al., 2018 ).However, alternative crops \nin the MRD are planted at the end of the wet season when soil salinity is \nlow, thus seed priming is of less relevance.An alternative seed preparation technique that mitigates the nega-\ntive effects of soil salinity is the use of plant growth-promoting bacterial \n(PGPB) endophytes (Ali et al., 2014 ).']
What are some alternative crops and management techniques that can be used to mitigate the effects of dry season salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta?	Alternative crops that can be used to mitigate the effects of dry season salinity intrusion in the Mekong River Delta include familiar crops like maize and soybean, as well as novel crops such as quinoa and cowpea. Management techniques that can be used include mulching and soil moisture monitoring. Mulching with organic materials or plastic coverings can help maintain soil moisture, reduce evaporation, and decrease the concentration of surface salt. Soil moisture monitoring can help producers develop an irrigation schedule that will improve water use efficiency and minimize the amount of saline water applied. Other management options include surface soil mulches and plastic coverings to maintain soil moisture and reduce salinity damage to plants, and the use of drainage and seed preparation techniques to improve plant establishment and yield.

What is the impact of high salinity stress on plant growth and how can it be ameliorated according to the research mentioned in the context?	High salinity stress can negatively affect plant growth. However, it can be ameliorated by using plant growth-promoting bacterial endophytes that contain ACC deaminase. Additionally, pre-sowing seed treatment can improve germination, plant growth, and crop yield under saline conditions. Another method to mitigate the adverse effects of salt stress on germination, growth, photosynthetic efficiency, and yield in maize is through magnetopriming. Furthermore, the use of different seed priming agents can promote sorghum germination under salt stress.

it provides an \nimportant water source for over 70 million people (R¨as¨anen et al., \n2017 ).Fertile alluvial soils have been deposited along the Mekong River, \nbut the presence of anaerobic conditions in subsoils means that acid \nsulfate soils are widely present throughout the Delta (Nguyen et al., \n2020b ).The 40,000 km2 of MRD productive land mass sits marginally \nabove sea level (<5 m) (Anh et al., 2019 ) and is dominated by rice \nproduction (Nguyen et al., 2020b ).Approximately two-thirds of the MRD is dedicated to agricultural \nproduction.Agriculture has been estimated to account for approxi -\nmately 40% of regional GDP and to provide for the livelihoods of over \n75% of people, leaving the economy of the MRD particularly exposed to \nnegative impacts on agricultural production arising from saline intru-\nsion (Mackay and Russell, 2011 ).Rice production is fundamental to the \neconomic function and livelihoods of the people of the MRD (Nguyen \net al., 2020c ).With an average annual production of 24.9 million tonnes, \nVietnam is the fifth largest rice producing country in the world and a net \nexporter of rice (CGIAR, 2016 ).The MRD accounts for 12% of the total \narea of Vietnam but provides >50% of the total paddy area planted in \nVietnam (General-Statisitcs-Office., 2019 ).This contributes to 56% of \nthe total rice produced and provides income for up to 80% of the MRD \npopulation.Rice yield varies from year to year largely due to a range of \nclimatic factors.For example, in 2019 the paddy rice production was 0.6 \nMt.less than average due to a combination of drought and hot weather.', 'Nguyen, B., Hay, N., Due, L.A., Hung, B.N., 2016.Viet Nam agricultural machinery \nindustry.AMA, Agricult.Mech.Asia, Africa nd Latin America 47, 67–70.Nguyen, B., Nguyen, V., Lanh, N., Bui, T.-A., 2020a.Mekong River Delta agricultural \nmechanization development: case study in Vinh Long Province, Viet Nam.Int.J. \nAdv.Sci.Eng.Inform.Technol.10, 736.Nguyen, K., Nguyen, H., Cramb, R., 2020b.Trends in Rice-Based Farming Systems in the \nMekong Delta .Nguyen, Q.H., Tran, D.D., Dang, K.K., Korbee, D., Pham, L.D.M.H., Vu, L.T., Luu, T.T., \nHo, L.H., Nguyen, P.T., Ngo, T., Nguyen, D.T.K., Wyatt, A., Van Aalst, M., Tran, T.A., \nSea, W.B., 2020c.Land-use dynamics in the Mekong delta: from national policy to \nlivelihood sustainability.Sustain.Dev.28, 448–467.Otsuka, K., Fan, S., 2001.Agricultural Development: New Perspectives in a Changing \nWorld.Washington International Food Policy Research Institute .Oumarou, H., Falalou, H., Taya, B., Mahamane, S., Vadez, V., 2015.Water use, \ntranspiration efficiency and yield in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and peanut \n(Arachis hypogaea) across water regimes.Crop Pasture Sci.66.Oveisi, M., 2017.Cardinal temperatures for seed germination of three quinoa \n(Chenopodium quinoa Willd.)cultivars.Iran.J.

What are the potential effects of salinity stress on the growth and yield of crops like cowpea and mustard, according to the studies mentioned in the context?	Salinity stress can affect the growth and yield of crops like cowpea and mustard in various ways. For cowpea, salt-tolerant varieties have been observed to osmotically adjust by accumulating higher concentrations of sodium (Na+) in their roots during vegetative stages to minimize salinity damage. The production of proteins involved in photorespiratory pathways also increases in cowpea plants exposed to salinity. In the case of mustard greens, an overexpression of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) was found in saline tolerant varieties, which was associated with an increased sequestration of Na+ in roots. However, the crop's ability to withstand salinity exposure during vegetative and reproductive growth is of utmost importance. Both cowpea and mustard greens have demonstrated high tolerance to salinity. The successful inoculation of cowpea played a significant role in the crop's ability to withstand increased salt concentrations.

Jacobsen et al., 2003 ).Characterisa -\ntion of the salt overly sensitive gene (SOS1) involved in salt sensory \nmechanisms has occurred in quinoa (Maughan et al., 2009 ) with the \nplant demonstrating the ability to rapidly sequester salt into the vacuole \nto prevent the accumulation of cytoplasmic Na+(Cai and Gao, 2020 ).An \noverexpression of the SOS1 gene was also found in saline tolerant \nmustard greens (Brassica juncea) that was associated with an increased sequestration of Na+in roots (Singh et al., 2019 ).Proline is an osmo -\nprotectant that plays a critical role in counteracting osmotic stress and \nincreased concentrations of proline have been found in salt-stressed \nmaize (Zea mays) plants (Kaya et al., 2010 ).Whilst alternative crops have differing cellular physiological salt \ntolerance mechanisms, salinity also affects the agronomy and conse -\nquential yield in different ways.Seedlings are generally sensitive to salt \nexposure; however, seedlings of alternative crops are planted when soil \nsalinity levels are low.For this review, germination and seedling toler-\nance is irrelevant and will not be further investigated.Priority lays with \nan alternative crops ability to withstand salinity exposure during vege-\ntative and reproductive growth.Ultimately, the precedence is a crops \nability to produce marketable yield in a saline environment.Table 2 \nsummarises the yield response of alternative crop options at varying salt \nconcentrations including a relative ranking.Quinoa proves very salt tolerant and successfully produces grain \n(Hussain et al., 2020 ) at similar concentrations recorded in canals dur-\ning extreme salinisation events in the MRD (Eslami et al., 2019 ), whilst \ncowpea and mustard greens demonstrate high tolerance.The successful \ninoculation of cowpea played a significant role in the crops ability to \nwithstand increased salt concentrations (Manaf and Zayed, 2015 ).The \nreproductive phases of maize are affected by salinity with decreased \nkernel set and grain weight (Kaya et al., 2010 ) and consequentially, is \nranked lower than cowpea and mustard greens.Soybean has a low \ntolerance and ranks similarly to rice, although salt-tolerant soybean \nvarieties can increase photosynthetic rates to generate ~47% greater \ngrain yields than salt-sensitive varieties (He et al., 2016 ).', 'However, the higher water \nrequirement of maize and soybean may limit the crops suitability for \nlarger scale growth as an alternative to rice.Another possible alternative crop is quinoa; this tolerates a wide \nrange of temperatures (5–35 ◦C) (Oveisi, 2017 ) and is highly drought \nresistant with a low water requirement (Algosaibi et al., 2017 ; Telahigue \net al., 2017 ).Whilst its growth is not common in Vietnam, it has been \nsuccessfully grown in conditions similar to the MRD dry season (Choukr- \nAllah et al., 2016 ).However, quinoa ’s sensitivity to waterlogging \n(Gonz ´alez et al., 2009 ) would require careful management following its \ngrowth after a rice crop.Implementation of raised bed systems might \nsuccessfully alleviate waterlogging issues (Bakker et al., 2010 ).Mustard greens is affected by heat stress (35/15 ◦C) at early flow-\nering stages although biomass production is unaffected at moderate \ntemperatures (day/night) of 28/15 ◦C (Angadi et al., 2000 ).Cowpea has \nbeen successfully grown in the dry season of Niger where temperatures \nFig.6.An overlay of dry season canal salinity concentrations (average of Soc Trang and Dai Ngai) with average monthly rainfall and crop growing duration for \nquinoa, cowpea, mustard greens, maize, soybean and rice (Salinity data from Ratering Arntz (2018) .B.

What are the potential impacts of climate change-induced sea level rise on seawater intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, according to the context provided?	The potential impacts of climate change-induced sea level rise on seawater intrusion in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, include an average sea level rise of 3 mm per year. It is forecasted that sea levels will rise from 0.3 to 0.8 m by 2081 –2100, which could affect 75% of the land area and result in 70% of the population being inundated. Additionally, land subsidence is occurring at a rate equal to or faster than sea level rise, with an average of 1.1–2.5 mm per year. This land subsidence, combined with tidal fluctuations, can exacerbate saline intrusion.
